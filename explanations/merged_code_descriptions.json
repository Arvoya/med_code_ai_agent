The cavity contains pus (abscess, purulent fluid, suppurative collection, empyema).  \n2. The surgeon passes THROUGH the deep (investing) fascia to reach the collection; it lies inside muscle or immediately beneath fascia.  \n3. The surgeon merely drains the cavity (incision, break-up of loculations, irrigation ± drain placement). The wall of the cavity is left in place; nothing is excised en bloc.  \n4.

WHAT THE SURGEON ACTUALLY DOES\n• Introduces a rigid or flexible nasal endoscope to the middle meatus.  \n• Identifies the NATURAL MAXILLARY OSTIUM.  \n• Widens the ostium by shaving a rim of mucosa ± a sliver of bone.  \n• Scope NEVER goes beyond the ostial edge; NOTHING is removed from the maxillary sinus cavity.  \n• Goal: create a bigger “door” so the sinus will drain/ventilate better, then withdraw the scope.\n\n2. THE “CYST / POLYP / MUCOCELE” RULE\n• If a very small lesion sitting right on the ostial rim must be nicked, shaved, or curetted SOLELY to open the door, stay with 31256.  \n• The moment the surgeon ENTERS the sinus cavity to scoop, debride, or remove any substantial cyst, polypoid tissue, fungus, pus, tumor, or debris, you must convert to 31267 (antrostomy WITH tissue removal).\n\n3. USE 31256 WHEN DOCUMENTATION SAYS\n✓ “Endoscopic maxillary antrostomy performed; ostium enlarged only.”  \n✓ “Minimal mucosal trimming; no tissue sent to pathology.”  \n✓ “Scope not advanced into the sinus.”  \n✓ Part of multi-sinus FESS where ONLY the maxillary ostium is opened and no intramaxillary work is done.\n\n4.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS\n• “FESS” does NOT automatically equal 31255 or 31267. Verify which sinus was treated and whether material was removed.  \n• Phrases like “sinus cleared” or “blockage relieved” are NOT enough—look for explicit words such as “debrided,” “removed from within,” “tissue sent to pathology” to justify 31267.  \n• Trimming a tiny cyst on the ostial lip is still 31256 because the instrument never enters the sinus cavity proper.\n\n6.

Comprehensive Physical Examination  \n   • 1995 rules: 8 + organ systems examined/ documented, OR  \n   • 1997 rules: a single-system “complete” exam template  \n3. HIGH-Complexity Medical Decision Making (MDM)  \n   • Extensive diagnoses and/or data review AND/OR very high risk (e.g., life-threatening condition, need for IV vasoactive drugs, possible major surgery, etc.)\n\nTime reference ≈ 70 minutes, but time alone never justifies 99223; the note must prove the three elements above.\n\nCYST-RELATED ADMISSIONS  \n• Patient is formally admitted (inpatient or observation) for a complex, infected, recurrent, or otherwise high-risk cyst that may need IV antibiotics, surgical consultation, or emergent OR:  \n  – If the ADMITTING NOTE documents a comprehensive history, comprehensive exam, and high-complexity MDM, report 99223.  \n  – ALSO report the procedure code for the cyst intervention (e.g., 10060-10061 for I&D, 1140x for excision) and append modifier ‑25 to 99223 to show the E/M service is “separately identifiable.”  \n• If the cyst is treated in the office or ED and the patient is NOT admitted, bill only the procedure (plus a lower-level office/ED E/M if separately documented). Do NOT use 99223.\n\nWHAT 99223 IS NOT  \n✘ Not supported by merely an “extended” history, a “detailed” exam, a long note, or total time spent.

Without a complete ROS (10 +) and complete PFSH, the history is not comprehensive. Without 8 + systems (1995) or a complete single-system exam (1997), the exam is not comprehensive.  \n• A high-risk diagnosis (e.g., chest pain) alone does not create high-complexity MDM; the documentation must reflect extensive data review, multiple management options, or very high risk of morbidity/mortality.  \n• Copy-and-paste ROS/PE templates do not count unless each element is actually addressed and pertinent negatives/positives are noted.\n\nHOW TO CHOOSE AMONG THE INITIAL-HOSPITAL CODES  \n• 99221 – Detailed OR comprehensive history & exam + straightforward/LOW MDM (~30 min).  \n• 99222 – COMPREHENSIVE history & exam + MODERATE MDM (~50 min).  \n• 99223 – COMPREHENSIVE history & exam + HIGH MDM (~70 min).  \n• 99220 – Highest-level INITIAL OBSERVATION care when the patient never converts to inpatient status.\n\nQUICK CHECKLIST BEFORE SELECTING 99223  \n☐ HPI ≥ 4 elements or status of ≥ 3 chronic problems  \n☐ ROS ≥ 10 systems  \n☐ PFSH includes past, family, and social history  \n☐ Exam documents ≥ 8 organ systems (1995) or complete single-system (1997)  \n☐ MDM shows extensive problems/data and/or very high risk  \nIf ANY box is unchecked, drop to 99222 or 99221.\n\nBOTTOM LINE  \nReport 99223 only when the admitting note truly demonstrates:  \n1) a fully comprehensive history,  \n2) a fully comprehensive exam, and  \n3) high-complexity MDM.  \nBill cyst I&D or excision separately and append modifier ‑25 to 99223 when the admission documentation meets these criteria."

Medical decision making: LOW complexity, or 15-29 minutes total time spent by the provider on the date of the visit.  \n• Typical examples: follow-up to check symptom progression, medication tolerance, or wound healing; discussion of test results; evaluation of a benign skin lesion (e.g., an epidermal cyst) when no procedure is performed at the same visit.\n\nCyst‐related guidance  \n• If the visit is ONLY to evaluate a cyst and decide on treatment, use 99213 when the above history/exam/MDM criteria are met.  \n• If the cyst is actually incised/drained or excised during the same session, code the procedure (e.g., 10060–10061 for I&D; 11400–11406 for benign excision) and append modifier -25 to 99213 only if a separately identifiable E/M service was provided in addition to the procedure.\n\nCommon misconceptions  \n✗ “Any brief follow-up is 99212.” — Wrong. Asking about symptom progress + reviewing meds + limited multi-system exam usually meets the extra elements needed for 99213.  \n✗ “99213 covers the cyst excision itself.” — No. 99213 is an E/M code, not a surgical code; bill the excision separately.  \n✗ “Time alone determines the level.” — Time may be used, but the required history, exam, and MDM elements (or time range of 15-29 min) must be documented.\n\nHow it differs from neighboring codes  \n• 99212: problem-focused history AND exam (chief complaint + brief HPI only; exam of 1 area/system) with straightforward MDM or <15 min.  \n• 99214: detailed history & exam (four HPI elements, 2-9 ROS, 1 P/F/S history; multi-system or detailed exam) with MODERATE MDM or 30-39 min.  \n• 99215: comprehensive history & exam with HIGH-complexity MDM or ≥40 min.\n\nUse 99213 whenever the documentation reaches the expanded problem-focused threshold and decision making is low complexity—exactly the scenario of a follow-up visit where symptoms and medications are reviewed and a limited exam is performed."

Evaluation only (discussion of cyst, options, consent) → report 99201.  \n2. Evaluation AND removal/drainage at the same session →  \n   • Report the procedure code (e.g., 11402 for 1.1–2.0-cm benign skin-lesion excision, 10060 for simple I&D).  \n   • Add 99201-25 ONLY if the history/exam/MDM clearly go beyond what is inherent to the procedure and the patient is new.\n\nCommon misconceptions—avoid these traps  \n✘ 99201 is NOT for established patients; the correct parallel for an established patient with the same limited history/exam is 99212.  \n✘ A “routine check-up” does not automatically equal 99212; the NEW vs. ESTABLISHED status is the deciding factor.  \n✘ 99201 never describes the procedure itself (excision, I&D, biopsy, etc.).  \n✘ Do not up-code to 99202–99204 unless the documentation includes the additional history/exam elements those codes require.\n\nQuick comparison  \n• 99201 – NEW patient, problem-focused Hx/Exam, straight-forward MDM.  \n• 99202 – NEW patient, expanded problem-focused Hx/Exam.  \n• 99203 – NEW patient, detailed Hx/Exam.  \n• 99204 – NEW patient, comprehensive Hx/Exam.  \n• 99212 – ESTABLISHED patient, problem-focused Hx/Exam (same depth as 99201).\n\nExam-question tip  \nIf a test item asks only about the “level of history (problem-focused)” and does NOT state whether the patient is new or established, 99201 is the CPT reference code that explicitly defines that history level in the CPT manual."

EXPANDED PROBLEM-FOCUSED history + exam + straight-forward medical-decision-making (MDM)  \n     – Chief complaint and 1–3 HPI elements, AND  \n     – At least ONE additional data element (≥ 1 Review-of-Systems question OR any pertinent Past/Family/Social History).  \n     – Exam may be limited to one organ system but must include a second element (e.g., general appearance or vital signs).  \n  2. Time: 15–29 total minutes of provider work on the date of service (face-to-face and non-face-to-face).\n\nKEY DIFFERENCES FROM NEARBY CODES (HISTORY/EXAM METHOD)  \n• 99201  – Problem-focused history/exam ONLY (single system, no ROS/PFSH); < 15 min. **(Deleted in 2021; if the test still lists it, that is the correct choice for a single-system, problem-focused history.)**  \n• 99202  – Expanded problem-focused history/exam OR 15–29 min with straight-forward MDM.  \n• 99203  – Detailed history/exam (multiple ROS + PFSH) OR 30–44 min with low-complexity MDM.  \n• 99204/99205 – Comprehensive histories/exams OR ≥ 45 min with moderate/high MDM.\n\nQUICK “IS IT 99202?” CHECKLIST  \n☑ New patient  \n☑ Chief complaint + brief HPI  \n☑ PLUS at least one ROS or pertinent PFSH element  \n☑ Straight-forward MDM OR 15–29 min documented time  \n→ Missing any of these?  drop to 99201.  More ROS/PFSH or longer time?  consider 99203+.\n\nCOMMON MISCONCEPTIONS  \n✗ Coding 99202 when the note shows only a problem-focused history/exam (single system, zero ROS/PFSH) – that is 99201.  \n✗ Using 99202 to bill for the surgical procedure itself (e.g., cyst excision) – procedures have their own CPT codes.  \n✗ Believing that “complex history” or “lab work ordered” automatically raises a visit to 99202 without the required extra ROS/PFSH or documented time.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE – CYST-RELATED ENCOUNTERS  \nPre-op or consult visit for an epidermal inclusion cyst:  \n• Bill 99202 only if you document an expanded problem-focused history/exam (e.g., skin HPI + ROS of “no fever or chills”) and the MDM is straight-forward (plan = schedule simple excision).  \n• The actual cyst excision or I&D is NOT reported with 99202 – use 11400-11446 (benign lesion excision) or 10060-10061 as appropriate.  \n• Post-op visits inside the global period are bundled; outside the global period you may again bill 99202 if the documentation meets the criteria above.\n\nBOTTOM LINE  \nIf all you see is “brief history focusing mainly on the respiratory system” with no additional ROS/PFSH and no time statement, the visit is problem-focused → 99201 (if the code is still available on the test). Add just one ROS or pertinent PFSH item, or document 15–29 minutes, and the encounter crosses the threshold to 99202."

Use M17.1 only when BOTH knees are affected.  \n• M17.1 is a diagnosis code only; it does not describe, include, or replace any surgical procedure.\n\nCyst-related clarification  \n• Excision of a popliteal (Baker’s) cyst or any other knee cyst is a separate procedure. Report the appropriate CPT code for the cyst excision (e.g., 27347) in addition to the diagnosis code M17.1.  \n• Never rely on M17.1 by itself to represent the removal of a cyst; it simply documents the underlying bilateral primary OA.\n\nDistinguishing M17.1 from look-alike codes  \n• M17.0 – Unilateral primary OA of knee, laterality not specified.  \n• M17.10/M17.11/M17.12 – Unilateral primary OA, unspecified/right/left knee.  \n• M17.2 – Unilateral post-traumatic OA of knee.  \n• M17.3 – Bilateral post-traumatic OA of knee.  \n\nQuick check  \nDoes the documentation clearly state primary osteoarthritis in BOTH knees?  \nYES ➜ code M17.1.  \nNO ➜ review laterality and etiology and choose the more specific code.",
