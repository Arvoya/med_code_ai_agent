No dissection into fascia, muscle, tendon, joint, or bone is performed, and no native tissue is excised other than the minimal skin/fat that must be traversed.\n\nWhen 20020 is billable  \n✓ Foreign object is sitting in the subcutaneous layer.  \n✓ Surgeon makes a small, direct cut, lifts out the object, irrigates, and closes—nothing more.  \n✓ The foreign-body removal is the sole purpose of the operation.\n\nWhen 20020 is NOT billable (key test phrase: “Is the surgeon cutting out the patient’s own tissue?”)  \n✘ Cyst, lipoma, ganglion, synovial, sebaceous, mucous, or any other mass composed of the patient’s cells. Those are tissue excisions, not foreign-body removals.  \n   – Use benign-lesion excision codes that match location and size (11400-11446 for skin; 24071-24076 for soft-tissue upper arm, etc.).  \n✘ Incision & drainage of abscess, hematoma, seroma → 20005 (deep abscess) or 20010 (simple hematoma/seroma).  \n✘ Exploration of open wounds → 20100-20103.  \n✘ Removal of objects in muscle, tendon, joint, or bone, or removals requiring extensive dissection → 20670-20680 or other musculoskeletal codes.  \n✘ Incidental foreign-body removal done during some other primary procedure.\n\nCommon misconceptions  \n• “Cyst” is never a foreign body. Excision of any cyst is coded as a lesion excision, never with 20020.  \n• “Simple” in the code title refers to the straightforward nature of the extraction, not to the size of the incision or lesion.  \n• 20020 is not a fallback code for any unspecified arm procedure; it is narrowly limited to subcutaneous foreign-body extraction.\n\nQuick decision rule  \nObject removed = exogenous material? Subcutaneous? Small incision? Only goal of the case? → 20020.  \nObject removed = patient’s own tissue (cyst/mass) or any abscess/hematoma? → Do NOT use 20020; pick the appropriate excision or I&D code.\n\nBottom line  \nCPT 20020 is used ONLY for uncomplicated, open removal of an embedded foreign object in subcutaneous tissue.

Comprehensive History  \n     – HPI: 4+ elements ­or status of 3+ chronic problems  \n     – ROS: 10 or more systems reviewed  \n     – PFSH: past, family and social history all recorded  \n  2.

History: chief complaint + brief HPI + ONE additional element (either one ROS or one pertinent P/F/S history).  \n  2. Examination: limited exam of the affected body area/organ system PLUS at least one related or symptomatic system (expanded problem-focused exam).  \n  3. Medical decision making: LOW complexity, or 15-29 minutes total time spent by the provider on the date of the visit.  \n• Typical examples: follow-up to check symptom progression, medication tolerance, or wound healing; discussion of test results; evaluation of a benign skin lesion (e.g., an epidermal cyst) when no procedure is performed at the same visit.\n\nCyst‐related guidance  \n• If the visit is ONLY to evaluate a cyst and decide on treatment, use 99213 when the above history/exam/MDM criteria are met.  \n• If the cyst is actually incised/drained or excised during the same session, code the procedure (e.g., 10060–10061 for I&D; 11400–11406 for benign excision) and append modifier -25 to 99213 only if a separately identifiable E/M service was provided in addition to the procedure.\n\nCommon misconceptions  \n✗ “Any brief follow-up is 99212.” — Wrong. Asking about symptom progress + reviewing meds + limited multi-system exam usually meets the extra elements needed for 99213.  \n✗ “99213 covers the cyst excision itself.” — No. 99213 is an E/M code, not a surgical code; bill the excision separately.  \n✗ “Time alone determines the level.” — Time may be used, but the required history, exam, and MDM elements (or time range of 15-29 min) must be documented.\n\nHow it differs from neighboring codes  \n• 99212: problem-focused history AND exam (chief complaint + brief HPI only; exam of 1 area/system) with straightforward MDM or <15 min.  \n• 99214: detailed history & exam (four HPI elements, 2-9 ROS, 1 P/F/S history; multi-system or detailed exam) with MODERATE MDM or 30-39 min.  \n• 99215: comprehensive history & exam with HIGH-complexity MDM or ≥40 min.\n\nUse 99213 whenever the documentation reaches the expanded problem-focused threshold and decision making is low complexity—exactly the scenario of a follow-up visit where symptoms and medications are reviewed and a limited exam is performed."

Evaluation only (deciding whether to remove a cyst, discussing options, obtaining consent) → 99201 if the patient is NEW and the documentation is problem-focused.  \n2. Evaluation + removal or drainage of the cyst at the same encounter →  \n   • Report the appropriate surgical code (e.g., 11402 for 1.1–2.0 cm benign skin-lesion excision, 10060 for simple I&D).  \n   • Add 99201-25 ONLY if the history/exam/decision making go beyond what is routinely necessary for the procedure and the patient is new.\n\nQuick differentiation matrix  \nNEW patient codes  \n• 99201 – problem-focused history & exam (brief), straight-forward MDM.  \n• 99202 – expanded problem-focused history & exam.  \n• 99203 – detailed history & exam.  \n• 99204 – comprehensive history & exam.  \n\nESTABLISHED patient codes  \n• 99211 – no physician-provided history/exam required (nurse visit).  \n• 99212 – problem-focused history & exam (same depth as 99201 but for established patients).  \n\nKey takeaway  \n99201 = NEW patient + minimal (problem-focused) history and exam.  \nIf the patient is established, use 99212; if a procedure such as cyst excision is done, code the procedure separately and append 99201-25 only when the evaluation is separately identifiable."

History / Exam – EXPANDED problem-focused  \n     – Chief complaint + 1–3 HPI elements, AND  \n     – At least ONE “extra” data point (≥1 Review-of-Systems question OR any pertinent Past/Family/Social History).  \n     – Physical exam may be limited to one system but must show a second element (e.g., vitals, general appearance) to mirror the expanded history.  \n     – Medical decision making is straightforward.\n\n          OR  \n\n  2. Time – 15-29 minutes of total face-to-face and non-face-to-face physician/QHP time spent that day.\n\nKEY DIFFERENCE FROM NEIGHBORING CODES  \n99201  = Brief, single-system history/exam only (problem-focused), <15 min.  \n99202  = Brief + ONE extra ROS / PFSH element (expanded), 15-29 min.  \n99203  = Several ROS plus PFSH (detailed) OR 30-44 min with moderate MDM.  \n99204+ = Comprehensive histories/exams or ≥45 min with higher-level MDM.\n\nIf you see only “brief history on the respiratory system,” the level is problem-focused → 99201, NOT 99202. Add just one more ROS or pertinent PFSH item and you cross the threshold to 99202.\n\nCOMMON MISCONCEPTIONS  \n✘ Coding 99202 when the note shows a single-system, problem-focused history (this is 99201).  \n✘ Using 99202 to report the procedure itself—surgical services are coded separately.  \n✘ Believing medical decision making alone can raise a visit from 99201 to 99202 without the required extra ROS/PFSH or time.\n\nCYST-RELATED ENCOUNTERS  \n• Pre-op/consult visit for a simple epidermal inclusion cyst: bill 99202 only if the provider performs an expanded problem-focused history/exam (e.g., skin HPI + ROS of “no fever or chills”) and the MDM remains straightforward (plan: schedule simple excision).  \n• The actual cyst excision is NOT 99202—use 11400-11446 (benign lesion excision) or 10060-10061 (I&D), as appropriate.  \n• Post-op visits inside the global period are bundled; outside the global period, bill 99202 again only if the expanded history/exam or 15-29 minutes of time is documented.\n\nQUICK CHECKLIST FOR 99202  \n☑ New patient  \n☑ Chief complaint + brief HPI  \n☑ PLUS at least one ROS or pertinent PFSH  \n☑ Straightforward MDM OR 15-29 minutes total provider time  \n→ If any element is missing, drop to 99201; if several ROS/PFSH items are documented, consider 99203."

Use M17.1 only when BOTH knees are affected.  \n• M17.1 is a diagnosis code only; it does not describe, include, or replace any surgical procedure.\n\nCyst-related clarification  \n• Excision of a popliteal (Baker’s) cyst or any other knee cyst is a separate procedure. Report the appropriate CPT code for the cyst excision (e.g., 27347) in addition to the diagnosis code M17.1.  \n• Never rely on M17.1 by itself to represent the removal of a cyst; it simply documents the underlying bilateral primary OA.\n\nDistinguishing M17.1 from look-alike codes  \n• M17.0 – Unilateral primary OA of knee, laterality not specified.  \n• M17.10/M17.11/M17.12 – Unilateral primary OA, unspecified/right/left knee.  \n• M17.2 – Unilateral post-traumatic OA of knee.  \n• M17.3 – Bilateral post-traumatic OA of knee.  \n\nQuick check  \nDoes the documentation clearly state primary osteoarthritis in BOTH knees?  \nYES ➜ code M17.1.  \nNO ➜ review laterality and etiology and choose the more specific code.",
