ONE-LINE DEFINITION  \nSingle scalpel incision in the natal cleft (sacrococcygeal “tail-bone” area) to release an abscess limited to the primary pilonidal pocket, followed by minimal irrigation / light packing—nothing more.\n\n2. CODE-IT CHECKLIST (EVERY BOX MUST BE ✓)  \n☐ Anatomic site = mid-line intergluteal / sacrococcygeal area (true pilonidal)  \n☐ Action words = “incision & drainage,” “stab incision,” “simple I&D”  \n☐ Complexity = ONE opening, no branching tracts, no wide excision  \n☐ Devices left behind = NONE (loose wick or light gauze is OK)  \n☐ No additional work = no curettage, no seton, no drain, no flap, no marsupialization  \n\nIf any box is ✗, do NOT bill 10080.\n\n3. FAST DECISION TREE (EXAM & REAL WORLD)  \nA. Where is the abscess?  \n   • Natal cleft / tail-bone → go to B.  \n   • Anywhere else (thigh, axilla, breast, groin, face, etc.) → use General Abscess Pathway (10060/10061/10160/10180).  \n\nB. Pilonidal location—what was done?  \n   • One incision, simple drainage → 10080  \n   • Multiple incisions, curettage, seton/drain, deroofing → 10081 (complicated)  \n   • Formal excision of cyst/sinus tracts → 11770–11772 (excision series)\n\n4. “RED-LIGHT” SITUATIONS—10080 IS WRONG IF:  \n✗ Site is NOT natal cleft (even if the note says “pilonidal-type abscess”).  \n✗ Only a needle or catheter used → 10160 (needle aspiration) or 10021 (FNA)  \n✗ Post-operative wound abscess → 10180  \n✗ Entire cyst/tracts excised → 11770–11772  \n✗ Penrose, suction drain, or seton left in place → 10081\n\n5. MOST COMMON MIX-UP: 10060 vs 10080  \n10060 = Simple I&D of abscess ANYWHERE on the body EXCEPT the natal cleft.  \n10080 = Simple I&D ONLY in the natal cleft.  \nQuick memory hook: “60 can go anywhere; 80 sits on the tail-bone.”\n\n6. MINI-SCRIPTS—WHAT TO CODE  \n✓ 10080 (CORRECT)  \n“1-cm midline incision within natal cleft; purulent fluid drained, cavity irrigated, iodoform wick placed. No secondary tracts.”  \n✗ 10060 (NOT 10080) – Thigh example  \n“1.5-cm fluctuant abscess on anterior thigh; single stab incision, pus evacuated, gauze packing inserted.”  \n✗ 10160 (NOT 10080) – Needle only  \n“18-g needle aspiration of axillary abscess; no scalpel incision performed.”  \n✗ 11770 (NOT 10080) – Excision  \n“Elliptical excision of pilonidal cyst with all sinus tracts down to fascia; wound closed primarily.”\n\n7. RAPID “YES/NO” STICKER FOR YOUR MONITOR  \nTail-bone? YES  \nScalpel cut? YES  \nSimple drain/pack only? YES  \n→ 10080  \nIf any answer is NO → pick 10060, 10061, 10081, 10160, 10180, or 11770-11772 as appropriate.\n\n8. REAL-WORLD TIP  \nOperative notes that say only “I&D abscess” are dangerous. Before you default to 10060/10061, scan for the words “intergluteal,” “natal cleft,” or “sacrococcygeal.” If absent, assume NOT pilonidal.\n\nBOTTOM LINE  \n10080 = Tail-bone + ONE scalpel incision + SIMPLE drainage.  \nAnything else?

THREE “LOCK-IN” QUESTIONS – all must be YES or code out:\n   A. Where is the lesion?   Below the patella AND above the malleoli (calf, shin, Achilles area, medial / lateral malleolus)      YES / NO  \n   B. How deep is it?        ONLY superficial / subcutaneous / bursal. No mention of fascia, muscle, deep compartments, or a drain left in place.      YES / NO  \n   C. What was done?         Simple I&D (incise, break loculations, irrigate, pack or loosely close). No counter-incisions, no complex closure.      YES / NO  \n\n   If ANY answer = NO → 20005 is wrong. Go to 20002 (thigh/knee), 20006 (deep lower-leg), or 10060/10061 (other body areas) as appropriate.\n\n2. THE #1 CONFUSION PAIR – 20005 vs. 20010  \n   • 20005 = DISTAL, lower-leg/ankle surface drain   (“I’m working near the cleats.”)  \n   • 20010 = PROXIMAL, upper-arm/elbow surface drain (“I can shake the patient’s hand.”)  \n   Mnemonic: ODD numbers march DISTAL (…-05 = lower leg) – EVEN numbers march PROXIMAL (…-10 = upper arm).\n\n   Football-collision hematoma, UPPER ARM → 20010, never 20005. Highlight this in audits; it is the most frequent mis-pick.\n\n3. COMMON TRAPS & SAFETY FLAGS\n   • Op note says “drain left in situ” or “deep lateral compartment opened” → automatically 20006 (deep).  \n   • Ankle, heel cord, malleolus abscess mistakenly sent out on 10060/10061 → change to 20005 (musculoskeletal section wins over integumentary).  \n   • “Just under the skin of the knee” but you can palpate patella → too high → 20002, not 20005.  \n   • Documentation uses vague term “leg” only: Force the surgeon to state CALF / SHIN / ANKLE or you cannot defend 20005.\n\n4. DOCUMENTATION CHECKLIST – have ALL THREE:\n   ☐ Exact distal-leg word (calf, shin, Achilles, ankle, medial/lateral malleolus)  \n   ☐ Depth descriptor (superficial, subcutaneous, seroma cavity, bursal)  \n   ☐ Simple I&D steps only, no drain left  \n\n   Miss one box? Query or recode.\n\n5. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES\n   ✓ “3-cm purulent seroma, right calf; 1-cm incision, blunt dissection, irrigation, iodoform packing.” → CPT 20005  \n   ✓ “Posterior ankle (Achilles) bursitis with abscess; superficial I&D performed, no drain.” → 20005  \n   ✗ “Hematoma, upper arm from football tackle; 2-cm incision, evacuated.” → 20010 (NOT 20005)  \n   ✗ “Deep intramuscular calf abscess; counter-incision, Penrose drain left.” → 20006  \n\n6. GLOBAL INFORMATION\n   • 10-day global period.  \n   • Bundles incision, drainage, manual breakup of loculations, irrigation, simple closure/packing.\n\nONE-LINE TAKEAWAY  \n20005 lives strictly between the knee joint line and the malleoli and stays superficial—think “simple surface drain on the shin/ankle.” Anything higher, lower, or deeper—STOP—pick a different code."

WHAT 20010 ACTUALLY PAYS FOR\n• A brand-new, surgical-suite incision that passes through ALL three layers  \n  – Skin → Sub-cutaneous fat → Investing fascia  \n  – Enters an intramuscular, inter-muscular, or sub-fascial space.  \n• Complete evacuation / lysis of loculations, copious irrigation, optional limited debridement, and placement of a drain or packing.  \n• Simple skin closure, if performed.\n\nB. THE TWO NON-NEGOTIABLE FENCEPOSTS  \n   1. PROXIMAL limit: just distal to the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint  \n   2. DISTAL limit: tip of the olecranon (elbow)  \n\nIf the operative note mentions ANY other anatomic region—shoulder, axilla, forearm, thigh, knee, hip, leg, chest wall, back, etc.—20010 is automatically wrong.\n\nC. 3-STEP “QUICK CHECK” BEFORE YOU CODE  \n1. Site                       → Is it clearly “upper arm” or “elbow”?  \n2. Depth                      → Was the fascia opened OR does the note state intra-/inter-muscular, sub-fascial, or deep space?  \n3. New Incision vs. Re-open   → Was a NEW cut made (or is there modifier 58/78/79 justification)?  \n\nYES to all three = 20010.  \nIf any answer is NO, look elsewhere (see Section E).\n\nD. MINIMUM DOCUMENTATION TO SUPPORT 20010  \n1. Laterality + exact site (“left distal upper arm,” “right posterior elbow”)  \n2. Statement of fascial entry / deep cavity (“fascia incised; cavity noted in intramuscular plane”)  \n3. Type + estimated volume of fluid evacuated  \n4. Details of irrigation, debridement, drain or packing  \n5. Confirmation this was a NEW incision (or modifier explanation)\n\nE. CODES MOST FREQUENTLY CONFUSED WITH 20010 — HOW TO TELL THEM APART\n\n• 27301  (Thigh / knee, deep): If the note says “thigh,” “quadriceps,” or “hamstring,” STOP — thigh has its own dedicated deep I&D code (27301). 20010 is never correct for thigh seromas or abscesses.  \n• 25028  (Forearm / wrist, deep): Same concept for distal arm.  \n• 27030  (Hip), 27603 (Leg), 20016 (Trunk, when no regional code exists) — Use the region-specific deep I&D code whenever it exists; default to 20016 only when NONE exists (e.g., chest wall, back).  \n• 10140  / 10160  (Superficial hematoma/seroma OR abscess): Use when tissue plane is limited to skin/sub-Q. These are “lump-in-office” procedures, not OR deep dissections.  \n• 20005  / 20055: These are highly specialized codes (e.g., ring removal, halo traction, etc.) and almost never correct for a routine extremity fluid collection. When you see a simple seroma or hematoma, mentally cross -out 20005 and 20055 unless the op note describes the very specific scenario printed in CPT.\n\nF. EXAM & REAL-WORLD “GOTCHAS”  \n• Thigh ≠ Arm: On tests, “seroma in the thigh” almost always maps to 27301—not 20010, 20005, or 20055.  \n• “Near the elbow” ≠ “Elbow”: Make sure the dictation states the incision was within the fenceposts and not on the proximal forearm.  \n• “Re-opening of recent incision” during the global period is bundled (modifier 78); do not assign 20010 unless modifier criteria are met.\n\nG. MEMORY HOOK  \n“Two joints guard 20010: shoulder above, elbow below. If you read anything outside those guards—drop the code and go to the region-specific option.”\n\n================================================================================"

Coding by history depth = wrong paradigm (applies to 99202-99215,\n   not preventive codes).  \n5. Same-day illness (e.g., ear pain) requires a separate, supported\n   problem-oriented E/M + ‑25, not a higher preventive code.  \n6. “Which code represents this level of history?”—classic test trick.\n   If age is absent, the safest answer is “cannot be determined.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLOOK-ALIKES & QUICK DIFFERENTIATORS\n• 99202-99215 Office/Outpatient E/M: chief complaint/diagnosis-driven,\n  history & exam are selected by medical necessity, not age.  \n• 99401-99404 Preventive counseling ONLY: no comprehensive exam performed.  \n• 99455-99456 Work/Disability evals.  \n• 99460-99463 Newborn inpatient preventive: hospital or birthing center,\n  not office.  \n\nMemory hook:  STATUS + AGE, or walk away.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSPEED-CHECK EXAMPLES\n• First-time visit, 9-month-old → NEW <1 yr → 99381.  \n• 3-yr-old yearly well-child, seen last year → EST 1-4 yr → 99392.  \n• 15-yr-old, chart silent on prior care → assume NEW 12-17 yr → 99384.  \n• 46-yr-old new patient physical → NEW 40-64 yr → 99386.  \n• Vignette lacks age → do NOT guess; answer “coding indeterminable.”\n\nSticky-note rule:  If AGE isn’t written, the code isn’t either."

DO-NOT-FALL-FOR-THESE TRAPS  \n\n1. “Detailed history + detailed exam = 99221.”  WRONG!  \n   History/exam bullets were deleted from inpatient leveling in 2023. Code is chosen ONLY by MDM OR total time.\n\n2. Copy-and-paste full ROS just to “earn” 99223.  Unnecessary and risky. Audit focus is on MDM/time and clinical relevance.\n\n3. Using extinct code 99220 (deleted 1-Jan-2023).  High-severity observation admits are now 99223.\n\n4. Billing 99223 on subsequent days (use 99231-99233) or same-day admit/discharge (use 99234-99236).\n\n====================================================================\n4. INSTANT DECISION FLOW  \n\n1. Admit/obs order & you are the attending? — NO → pick consult, ED, or subsequent codes.  \n2. ≥ 75 minutes total today? — YES → 99223 (document time).  \n3. If < 75 min, is MDM high? — YES → 99223.  \n4. Otherwise: moderate = 99222; low = 99221.\n\n====================================================================\n5. MINI-CASE CLARIFIERS  \n\nChest-pain myths exposed:  \n• Example 1 – Chest pain, troponin 14 ng/mL, ST depressions, heparin + cath lab planned. High risk → 99223 (high MDM).  \n• Example 2 – Chest wall strain, normal ECG, no high-risk meds. Low MDM, 48 min. → 99221.  \n• Example 3 – Same scenario as Q-bank error: “extended history, detailed exam,” but uncomplicated costochondritis, 20 min, low data, low risk. → 99221, NOT 99223. Reason: NOT high MDM and NOT 75 min, regardless of examination depth.\n\n====================================================================\n6.

      "explanation": "CPT 99213  –  Established patient, Office/Outpatient visit  \nCurrent (2021-forward) E/M rules\n\n1. What qualifies?\n   • EITHER Low-level Medical Decision Making (MDM) – OR – 20-29 minutes of total physician/qualified health-care professional (QHP) time on the date of service.  \n   • History and examination are performed “as medically appropriate” but are NOT scored. Do not try to count HPI elements or exam bullets; that methodology was retired.\n\n2. Key components for LOW-LEVEL MDM  \n   • 2 or more self-limited or minor problems ‑OR- 1 stable chronic illness ‑OR- 1 acute, uncomplicated illness or injury.  \n   • Limited data review/ordering (e.g., 1 external note, 1 test, or simple lab panel).  \n   • Low risk of morbidity (OTC treatment, simple prescription management, physical therapy, etc.).\n\n3. Typical visit clues\n   • Follow-up for hypertension, reflux, mild asthma, minor rash, medication adjustment, etc.  \n   • Physician reviews current meds, asks about symptom progress, performs a focused exam, possibly orders/refills a routine prescription.\n\n4. Typical total time\n   • 20–29 minutes spent face-to-face AND/OR on the same day in chart review, documentation, orders, patient communication, etc.\n\n5. Common confusions\n\n   99212  (Straightforward MDM or 10-19 min)  \n   • Usually 1 self-limited/minor problem, no prescription management, minimal data reviewed.  \n   • Example: re-check of a resolved URI, advice to continue home care, no new meds.\n\n   99214  (Moderate MDM or 30-39 min)  \n   • 1 chronic illness with exacerbation or 2+ stable chronic illnesses, or acute illness with systemic symptoms; moderate data; moderate drug-therapy risk.  \n   • Example: uncontrolled diabetes requiring med change and review of CMP, A1c, and ophthalmology note.\n\n   99215  (High MDM or 40-54 min)  \n   • Severe exacerbations, high-risk medication monitoring (e.g., warfarin with INR issues), decision regarding hospitalization, extensive data review.\n\n   Warning: A “limited exam” plus med review does NOT automatically equal 99212. If prescription drug management is involved or if two minor problems are addressed, LOW-level MDM is met → 99213.\n\n6. Documentation tips\n   • State problems addressed and status.  \n   • Note any prescription changes or counseling.  \n   • Briefly list data reviewed/ordered.  \n   • Record total time when selecting code by time.\n\n7. Do not down-code\n   • If you meet LOW-level MDM (or 20-29 min) but document 99212, revenue is lost and quality measures may be impacted.\n\nMnemonic: “1 stable problem + Rx = 213” (read “2-13”)."

The real solution was to pick 20016 (intramuscular upper-arm/shoulder area), not to default to 20100.  \nThis update drills in three points:  \n1. 20100 = posterior-trunk ONLY.  \n2. The anatomic “shoebox” for 20100 stops at the scapular spine and NEVER crosses onto the shoulder girdle.  \n3. If 23030 is absent, fall back to the next best SHOULDER/UPPER-ARM code (usually 20016, rarely 20010)―but never to 20100.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1. PLAIN-LANGUAGE DEFINITION (UNCHANGED)  \nA scalpel cut that starts on the back, penetrates skin, subQ fat, and the investing fascia, and ends inside or between the paraspinal muscles to evacuate pus or blood.  A drain is almost always placed.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n2. THE “BACK-SHOEBOX”—NOW WITH A HARD FRONT WALL  \n• Patient prone  \n• Ceiling – External occipital protuberance  \n• Floor   – Top of the inter-gluteal cleft  \n• Side walls – Right & left mid-axillary lines  \n• FRONT WALL – Scapular spines and posterior axillary folds  \nIf ANY part of the incision crosses that front wall (i.e., onto the scapula, acromion, deltoid, axilla), 20100 is WRONG.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n3. NEW HOT-SPOT MAP—SHOULDER FAMILY CODES\n\nRegion                       Deep I&D Code          Notes  \n──────────────────────────── ─────────────── ──────────────────────────────  \nShoulder / Scapula           23030             Gold-standard shoulder code  \nPROXIMAL Upper Arm / Deltoid 20016             Use when 23030 absent AND op note confirms\n                                              intramuscular or subfascial work in deltoid  \nDistal Upper Arm / Elbow     20010             Deep, but distal to deltoid insertion  \nPosterior Trunk (true back)  20100             ONLY inside the back-shoebox  \n\nMnemonic: “Scapula seen?  23-0-30.  Scapula code gone?  20-0-16.  Never 20-1-00.”\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n4. REVISED DEPTH / LOCATION WORK-FLOW\n\nSTEP 1 – Ask LOCATION first  \n• In the back-shoebox? → go to Step 2  \n• On or anterior to scapular spine? → shoulder/upper-arm family (23030 ▶ 20016 ▶ 20010)  \n• Buttock / hip? → 27301  \n• Lateral chest / axilla? → 21501  \n• Abd wall / flank? → 21935  \n\nSTEP 2 – Ask DEPTH next  \n• Skin / subQ only → 10180  \n• Fascia breached → verify abscess or hematoma  \n• Seroma / cyst / foreign body → different code set  \n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n5. DOCUMENTATION THAT “LOCKS IN” 20100 (UNCHANGED)  \n✓ Exact location inside shoebox (e.g., “4 cm left of L3 spinous process”)  \n✓ Investing fascia incised (thoracolumbar, lumbodorsal, etc.)  \n✓ Abscess or hematoma evacuated (+/– drain)  \n\nMISS **ANY** OF THE ABOVE?  DO NOT USE 20100.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n6. EXAM-STYLE PRACTICE—NOW INCLUDING THE SHOULDER TRAP  \n\nA. “Incision 5 cm over posterior deltoid; fascia opened, clot evacuated.”  \n   – Shoulder girdle, not true back.  \n   – If 23030 offered → PICK IT.  \n   – If NOT, look for 20016 before 20010.  NEVER 20100.  \n\nB. “Midline T12 incision; thoracolumbar fascia opened; purulence expressed; drain left.”  \n   – Checks all three boxes → 20100.  \n\nC. “Incision over scapular spine with deep hematoma evacuation.”  \n   – 23030 (shoulder), not 20100.  \n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n7. ONE-LINE MEMORY AID (UPDATED)  \n“Back-box ONLY = 20100.  \nTouch the scapula?  Try 23030—then 20016—then 20010, but NEVER 20100.”\n\nPost this, circle the “shoulder trap,” and you will never dump a shoulder hematoma into the posterior-trunk code again."

If you are coding with the 2021-present E/M rules, select 99202 (or time-based code) instead. If you are working under pre-2021 guidelines (some legacy payers, older test questions), the information below applies.\n\n1. Patient Status – the FIRST gate\n   • New Patient = has not received professional services from the physician/qualified health-care professional (or another of the same specialty/subspecialty in the same group) within the past 3 years.  \n   • If the visit is for a new patient, you MUST choose from 99201-99205; you may NEVER report 99211-99215 (established patient series), no matter how “routine” or “brief” the encounter is.  \n   → Most exam mistakes come from overlooking this rule.\n\n2. Key Components required (pre-2021 rules)\n   • Problem-focused history (brief HPI, no ROS or PFSH required).  \n   • Problem-focused examination (limited to the affected body area/organ system).  \n   • Straightforward medical decision making.  \n   All three elements must be met or exceeded.\n\n3. Time Threshold (pre-2021)\n   • Typical face-to-face time: 10 min.\n\n4. 2021-PRESENT rules (when 99201 is not reportable)\n   • The lowest level new-patient E/M is 99202.  \n   • Select 99202 when MDM is Straightforward OR when total physician/APP time is 15-29 min.\n\n5. Quick “Which Code?” Decision Grid\n   NEW pt + problem-focused/intake only → 99201 (legacy) or 99202 (current)  \n   ESTABLISHED pt + problem-focused/intake only → 99212  \n   Remember: Patient status overrides everything else.\n\n6. Common Confusion – 99201 vs. 99212\n   • 99201 = NEW patient; 99212 = ESTABLISHED patient.  \n   • Both may involve a problem-focused history/exam, but they are not interchangeable because the patient status is different.  \n   • Routine/wellness visits do NOT automatically make the patient “established.”\n\n7. Practical Example\n   Scenario: Jake is seen in your clinic for the first time. The provider documents a brief HPI (“feels well”), no ROS, no PFSH, performs a limited exam, makes no new diagnoses, and gives general health advice.  \n   • Pre-2021 code: 99201.  \n   • 2021+ code: 99202 (straightforward MDM or 15-29 min).\n\n8. Payer Alert\n   • Medicare and most commercial plans have removed 99201 from fee schedules. Attempting to bill it will result in denial; code 99202 where appropriate.  \n   • Always verify your payer’s adoption year for E/M guidelines.\n\nMnemonic to avoid mix-ups  \nN.E.W. = New Encounter → Use 9920X series  \nE.S.T. = Established → Use 9921X series  \n\nSummary: Use 99201 only for a NEW patient encounter meeting minimal/problem-focused criteria under pre-2021 rules.

For example, a physician who documents “Patient with flu-like symptoms; denies chest pain or SOB” has obtained a respiratory ROS and is therefore at 99202 at minimum.\n\nREAL-WORLD EXAMPLES  \n✓ Patient with sore throat; HPI covers onset/duration/severity, and physician asks about fever/ear pain (ENT ROS). → 99202  \n✗ Same patient, HPI only (“2-day sore throat”) with no ROS. → 99201 (before 2021)  \n✓ New patient with cough; HPI plus ROS of respiratory system; limited lung exam; straightforward MDM. → 99202\n\nCURRENT (2021+) GUIDELINES WARNING  \nCPT 99201 was deleted, and history/exam are no longer “counted” to select the code.
