Use an established patient code like 99391 in that case.\n\n**Practical Application:**\n*   **Use 99381 when:** A patient is seeing this provider for the *very first time* and requires a full, comprehensive history review. Think of patients moving from out-of-state or those with no prior relationship with the physician.\n*   **Do NOT use 99381 when:** The patient has had a similar, comprehensive checkup with this physician previously.
