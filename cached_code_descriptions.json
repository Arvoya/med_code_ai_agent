HIGH-YIELD WARNINGS (exam & real life)  \n✗ If the documentation says “thigh,” “axilla,” “groin,” “breast,” etc., **10080 is automatically wrong**—choose 10060/10061/10160 as appropriate.  \n✗ The word “pilonidal-type” in the note does NOT overrule location. A “pilonidal-type abscess on the thigh” is still NOT 10080.  \n✗ Needle only = 10160, even in the natal cleft.  \n✗ Use 10081 when the surgeon leaves a Penrose drain, places a seton, performs curettage, or opens several sinus tracts.  \n✗ Re-opening a post-operative wound is never 10080; it is 10180.\n\n5.

If the operative note says the surgeon removed the whole right or left lobe, choose 60220.  \n2. The term “lobectomy” in the endocrine surgery literature almost always means the whole lobe unless the surgeon explicitly states “partial.” Do not assume “lobectomy” is partial.\n\nCommonly Confused Codes  \n• 60210 – PARTIAL thyroid lobectomy, unilateral, with or without isthmusectomy. Use when only a PORTION of one lobe is excised (e.g., upper pole resection, wedge resection).  \n• 60212 – TOTAL lobectomy on one side + SUBTOTAL lobectomy on the opposite side (used in staged/extent-of-disease cases).  \n• 60225 – TOTAL lobectomy on one side + PARTIAL lobectomy on the opposite side.  \n• 60240 – Total thyroidectomy (both lobes completely removed).  \n• 60100 – Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of thyroid; no open resection.\n\nQuick Decision Checklist  \nA. Entire gland removed? → 60240  \nB. One entire lobe removed? → 60220  \nC. Only part of one lobe removed? → 60210  \nD. One entire lobe + some of the contralateral lobe removed?  \n • Subtotal other side → 60212  \n • Partial other side  → 60225  \nE. Needle biopsy only? → 60100\n\nDocumentation Tips  \n• Look for operative phrases such as “complete removal of the right lobe,” “total lobectomy,” or “remaining thyroid tissue on that side was excised in its entirety.”  \n• If the report says “partial lobectomy,” “hemithyroidectomy” with residual tissue, or specifies a polar/segmental resection, it is NOT 60220.  \n• Verify whether the isthmus was removed; it does NOT change the code selection for 60210 or 60220.\n\nCoder’s Warning  \nThe most frequent error is defaulting to 60210 whenever the word “lobectomy” appears. Always confirm whether the entire lobe was removed. If the surgeon is ambiguous, query for clarification before coding."

If a case report says “diagnostic renal angiography,” 50010 is WRONG.  \n• 50398 – Injection procedure for an antegrade nephrostogram/ureterogram  \n  – Contrast injected through an existing nephrostomy tube to study the collecting system.  \n  – Performed percutaneously, no surgical exploration.  \n• 50200 – Percutaneous (needle) renal biopsy  \n  – Small-gauge needle through the skin, usually with imaging guidance. No open incision.  \n• 50220 – Nephrectomy, partial or total  \n  – Removal of kidney tissue. If any portion of the kidney is excised with intent to remove, use a nephrectomy code, not 50010.\n\nRed-flag phrases that tell you 50010 is NOT the answer  \n“Catheter advanced into renal artery…contrast injected” → Think 36251-36254 + 75722.  \n“Contrast injected through nephrostomy tube”     → 50398.  \n“Core biopsy needle under CT guidance”       → 50200.  \n“Kidney removed/partial nephrectomy performed”   → 50220 series.\n\nQuick rule of thumb  \nIf you can put your hand on the kidney through an incision but you do NOT remove it, you are in 50010 territory. If you are only injecting contrast or working through a catheter or needle, look elsewhere."

A solitary polyp arising from the middle meatus was grasped with Takahashi forceps and excised. Hemostasis achieved with cautery. No endoscope utilized. The left side was normal.”\n\nBill 30110 once."

      "explanation": "99223 — Initial Hospital Inpatient OR Observation Care – LEVEL 3  \n“The HIGH-MDM / 75-Minute Admit” (2024 rules)\n\n================================================================\n1. ONE-LINE SNAPSHOT  \nFirst-calendar-day hospital OR observation encounter by the attending that involves ❶ HIGH-complexity Medical Decision Making or ❷ ≥ 75 minutes of the physician’s same-day work.\n\nMnemonic: H igh MDM or H our-plus (75 min) → 99223\n\n================================================================\n2. BILLING GATEKEEPERS (ALL must be “YES” before leveling)  \n□ Signed, date- & time-stamped admit/obs ORDER written by you.  \n□ You are the ATTENDING/primary team for that calendar day (consultants code 99252-99255 or 99221-99223 + -AI modifier on attending).  \n□ It is the PATIENT’S FIRST inpatient/obs calendar day. (Subsequent days = 99231-99233.)  \n\n================================================================\n3. TWO VALID PATHS TO 99223\n\nA. BY MEDICAL DECISION MAKING – ALL THREE ELEMENTS = HIGH  \n• Number/Complexity of PROBLEMS: Acute or chronic illness with threat to life or bodily function (e.g., STEMI, sepsis, massive PE, GI bleed with drop in Hb).  \n• DATA to review/order: Extensive – multiple labs, advanced imaging, external records, independent interpretation, discussions with another clinician, etc.  \n• RISK of complications/morbidity/mortality: High – emergent surgery, IV anticoag/vasoactive drips, BiPAP/vent, chemo, DNR/goals-of-care decisions, etc.\n\nB. BY TOTAL PHYSICIAN TIME – ≥ 75 MINUTES  \nCount ALL work personally performed on the calendar date: chart review, bedside, family conferences, care-coordination, orders, documentation.  \nDocument explicitly:  \n“Total physician time on 06-Mar-2024: 82 minutes ( >50 % counseling/coordination).”\n\n================================================================\n4. WHAT **DOES NOT** DETERMINE THE CODE (Post-2023 E/M rules)\n\n✘ Depth of History & Exam. Only “medically appropriate” is required; number of ROS systems, bullets, or exam elements NO LONGER affect 99221-99223 selection.  \n✘ Lengthy templates or copy-paste. Auditors ignore fluff and score by MDM or time.  \n✘ A dramatic-sounding diagnosis alone (e.g., “chest pain”). Code to the demonstrated severity and management, not the chief complaint.\n\nBIG RED FLAG: “Extended history + detailed exam” with LOW or MODERATE MDM still codes 99221 or 99222—not 99223. This is the most common audit failure.\n\n================================================================\n5. CODE-CONFUSION QUICK GUIDE\n\n• 99221  Low MDM     OR 40-54 min physician time  \n• 99222  Moderate MDM OR 55-74 min physician time  \n• 99223  High MDM     OR 75 min + physician time  \n\n• 99220  (Deleted 1-Jan-2023) – do not use. Observation admits now share 99221-99223.  \n\nRemember: Choose the HIGHER of MDM vs. Time, but you must meet at least one column completely.\n\n================================================================\n6. RAPID ALGORITHM\n\n1. Admit order + attending role? NO → use consult/ED/subsequent codes.  \n2. ≥ 75 min total work today? YES → 99223 (document minutes) → STOP.  \n3. If < 75 min, are ALL THREE MDM elements HIGH? YES → 99223 → STOP.  \n4. Otherwise: Moderate MDM → 99222; Low MDM → 99221.\n\n================================================================\n7. REAL-WORLD MINI-CASES\n\nA. Chest Pain with benign work-up  \n• ECG normal, Trop neg x2, NSAID given, discharge plan tomorrow.  \n• Time 38 min, MDM Low.  \nCorrect code: 99221 — NOT 99223.  \nKey lesson: Extensive Hx/Exam ≠ higher code without high MDM or 75 min.\n\nB. Unstable Angina  \n• Trop 12 ng/mL, ST depression, IV heparin, cardiology discussion, cath planned.  \n• MDM High (problems high risk, extensive data, high risk).  \n• Time 46 min.  \nCorrect code: 99223 via MDM path (time <75 min, but MDM is High).\n\nC. Complex Goals-of-Care Meeting  \n• Metastatic CA, code-status discussion with family, palliative plan.  \n• Total same-day physician time 78 min (majority counseling).  \n• Data minimal, risk high but assume Moderate.  \nCorrect code: 99223 via TIME path.\n\n================================================================\n8. COMMON TRIP WIRES & HOW TO AVOID THEM\n\n1. “Extended history + detailed exam” coding up: Not allowed—ignore exam bullets, focus on MDM/time.  \n2. Using 99223 for Day-2 progress notes. Use 99231-99233 after the calendar date flips.  \n3. Forgetting to DOCUMENT minutes or high-MDM evidence. If it isn’t written, it didn’t happen.  \n4. Consultants labeling themselves “attending.” Add modifier ‑AI to true attending to distinguish.  \n5. Billing deleted 99220 for observation admits—use 99221-99223.\n\n================================================================\n9. PEARL TO REMEMBER\nIf you cannot honestly say “Life-/organ-threatening complexity OR I personally worked ≥ 75 minutes,” you cannot bill 99223—no matter how beautiful the ROS and physical exam look."

      "explanation": "CPT 99213  –  Established patient, Office/Outpatient visit  \nCurrent (2021-forward) E/M rules\n\n1. What qualifies?\n   • EITHER Low-level Medical Decision Making (MDM) – OR – 20-29 minutes of total physician/qualified health-care professional (QHP) time on the date of service.  \n   • History and examination are performed “as medically appropriate” but are NOT scored. Do not try to count HPI elements or exam bullets; that methodology was retired.\n\n2. Key components for LOW-LEVEL MDM  \n   • 2 or more self-limited or minor problems ‑OR- 1 stable chronic illness ‑OR- 1 acute, uncomplicated illness or injury.  \n   • Limited data review/ordering (e.g., 1 external note, 1 test, or simple lab panel).  \n   • Low risk of morbidity (OTC treatment, simple prescription management, physical therapy, etc.).\n\n3. Typical visit clues\n   • Follow-up for hypertension, reflux, mild asthma, minor rash, medication adjustment, etc.  \n   • Physician reviews current meds, asks about symptom progress, performs a focused exam, possibly orders/refills a routine prescription.\n\n4. Typical total time\n   • 20–29 minutes spent face-to-face AND/OR on the same day in chart review, documentation, orders, patient communication, etc.\n\n5. Common confusions\n\n   99212  (Straightforward MDM or 10-19 min)  \n   • Usually 1 self-limited/minor problem, no prescription management, minimal data reviewed.  \n   • Example: re-check of a resolved URI, advice to continue home care, no new meds.\n\n   99214  (Moderate MDM or 30-39 min)  \n   • 1 chronic illness with exacerbation or 2+ stable chronic illnesses, or acute illness with systemic symptoms; moderate data; moderate drug-therapy risk.  \n   • Example: uncontrolled diabetes requiring med change and review of CMP, A1c, and ophthalmology note.\n\n   99215  (High MDM or 40-54 min)  \n   • Severe exacerbations, high-risk medication monitoring (e.g., warfarin with INR issues), decision regarding hospitalization, extensive data review.\n\n   Warning: A “limited exam” plus med review does NOT automatically equal 99212. If prescription drug management is involved or if two minor problems are addressed, LOW-level MDM is met → 99213.\n\n6. Documentation tips\n   • State problems addressed and status.  \n   • Note any prescription changes or counseling.  \n   • Briefly list data reviewed/ordered.  \n   • Record total time when selecting code by time.\n\n7. Do not down-code\n   • If you meet LOW-level MDM (or 20-29 min) but document 99212, revenue is lost and quality measures may be impacted.\n\nMnemonic: “1 stable problem + Rx = 213” (read “2-13”)."

If the note states “joint capsule opened” or “femoral/tibial components placed inside the knee,” 01400 is the correct anesthesia code."

      "explanation": "CPT 99201  (Problem-Focused Office/Outpatient Visit – NEW Patient)  \nSTATUS: Deleted 1-1-2021. If you are coding with the 2021-present E/M rules, select 99202 (or time-based code) instead. If you are working under pre-2021 guidelines (some legacy payers, older test questions), the information below applies.\n\n1. Patient Status – the FIRST gate\n   • New Patient = has not received professional services from the physician/qualified health-care professional (or another of the same specialty/subspecialty in the same group) within the past 3 years.  \n   • If the visit is for a new patient, you MUST choose from 99201-99205; you may NEVER report 99211-99215 (established patient series), no matter how “routine” or “brief” the encounter is.  \n   → Most exam mistakes come from overlooking this rule.\n\n2. Key Components required (pre-2021 rules)\n   • Problem-focused history (brief HPI, no ROS or PFSH required).  \n   • Problem-focused examination (limited to the affected body area/organ system).  \n   • Straightforward medical decision making.  \n   All three elements must be met or exceeded.\n\n3. Time Threshold (pre-2021)\n   • Typical face-to-face time: 10 min.\n\n4. 2021-PRESENT rules (when 99201 is not reportable)\n   • The lowest level new-patient E/M is 99202.  \n   • Select 99202 when MDM is Straightforward OR when total physician/APP time is 15-29 min.\n\n5. Quick “Which Code?” Decision Grid\n   NEW pt + problem-focused/intake only → 99201 (legacy) or 99202 (current)  \n   ESTABLISHED pt + problem-focused/intake only → 99212  \n   Remember: Patient status overrides everything else.\n\n6. Common Confusion – 99201 vs. 99212\n   • 99201 = NEW patient; 99212 = ESTABLISHED patient.  \n   • Both may involve a problem-focused history/exam, but they are not interchangeable because the patient status is different.  \n   • Routine/wellness visits do NOT automatically make the patient “established.”\n\n7. Practical Example\n   Scenario: Jake is seen in your clinic for the first time. The provider documents a brief HPI (“feels well”), no ROS, no PFSH, performs a limited exam, makes no new diagnoses, and gives general health advice.  \n   • Pre-2021 code: 99201.  \n   • 2021+ code: 99202 (straightforward MDM or 15-29 min).\n\n8. Payer Alert\n   • Medicare and most commercial plans have removed 99201 from fee schedules. Attempting to bill it will result in denial; code 99202 where appropriate.  \n   • Always verify your payer’s adoption year for E/M guidelines.\n\nMnemonic to avoid mix-ups  \nN.E.W. = New Encounter → Use 9920X series  \nE.S.T. = Established → Use 9921X series  \n\nSummary: Use 99201 only for a NEW patient encounter meeting minimal/problem-focused criteria under pre-2021 rules. Never use 99212 for a new patient. Under current guidelines, default to 99202 for the lowest-level new-patient visit."
