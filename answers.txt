DETAILED ANSWERS:
============================================================

Question 1: During a regular checkup, Dr. Stevens discovered a suspicious lesion on the floor of Paul's mouth and decided to perform an excision. Which CPT code covers the excision of an oral lesion?
    A. 40800
    B. 41105
>>> C. 41113
    D. 40804
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: CPT 41113 specifically describes “excision of lesion of floor of mouth,” which matches Dr. Stevens’ procedure. The other options involve either biopsy (41105) or lesions/incision procedures of the vestibule of the mouth (40800, 40804), not the floor.
Final Answer: C

Question 2: While shaving, Robert accidentally caused a small cut on his chin that later became infected. He visited a healthcare provider who incised and drained the infected area. Which CPT code covers the incision and drainage of an infected cut?
    A. 10080
    B. 10021
>>> C. 10060
    D. 10160
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The chin is a non-pilonidal site, and the clinician used a scalpel incision to drain an infected cut (i.e., a simple skin abscess). CPT 10060 specifically describes a simple/single incision and drainage of a cutaneous or subcutaneous abscess at any non-pilonidal location. The other codes are for pilonidal cyst drainage (10080), fine-needle aspiration biopsy (10021), or needle aspiration without a scalpel incision (10160), none of which match the described procedure.
Final Answer: C

Question 3: Lucas, a professional swimmer, developed a cyst in his arm due to repetitive motion. The doctor decided to excise the cyst. Which CPT code represents the excision of a cyst?
    A. 20005
>>> B. 20055
    C. 20010
    D. 20020
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 4)
Final Verified Answer: B
Reasoning: LLM Analysis:


Summary: Codes 20005, 20010, and 20020 all describe incision-and-drainage or foreign-body removal procedures; each explicitly states that they are NOT to be used when the surgeon completely excises a cyst or other mass. The only remaining option, 20055, is the lone code that could represent an excision, and no contradictory description has been provided to rule it out. Therefore, based on the supplied information, 20055 is the best available choice.
Final Answer: B

Question 4: Ella's doctor suspected she might have diabetes. He ordered a Hemoglobin A1c test to assess her average blood sugar levels over the past three months. Which CPT code represents the Hemoglobin A1c test?
>>> A. 83036
    B. 83033
    C. 83035
    D. 83034
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: CPT code 83036 is specifically designated for the Hemoglobin A1c test. The other codes correspond to different hemoglobin analyses or are not defined for A1c, making 83036 the clear match.
Final Answer: A

Question 5: Riley had an overactive thyroid and was recommended for a thyroid lobectomy. Which CPT code pertains to this procedure?
    A. 60210
    B. 60212
>>> C. 60220
    D. 60225
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: A “thyroid lobectomy” typically means removal of one entire thyroid lobe (usually with or without the isthmus). CPT 60220 is designated for a total (complete) unilateral thyroid lobectomy, matching that description. 60210 is only a partial lobectomy, while 60212 and 60225 involve additional contralateral or subtotal work beyond a straightforward lobectomy.
Final Answer: C

Question 6: After a series of tests, Dr. Wright determined that Katie had a kidney stone and recommended a percutaneous nephrostolithotomy. Which CPT code corresponds to this procedure?
    A. 50010
    B. 50020
    C. 50200
>>> D. 50543
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: CPT 50543 is specifically defined as “percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (or pyelostolithotomy),” which matches Dr. Wright’s recommended procedure. The other options describe renal exploratory surgery (50010), renal abscess drainage (50020), or renal biopsy (50200), none of which correspond to removing a kidney stone percutaneously.
Final Answer: D

Question 7: Ethan, experiencing persistent flank pain, underwent a diagnostic renal angiography. Which CPT code represents this procedure?
    A. 50010
    B. 50220
    C. 50200
>>> D. 50398
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 2)
Final Verified Answer: D
Reasoning: LLM Analysis:
50010  
• Type of service: An OPEN, retroperitoneal exploration of the kidney.  
• Purpose: Allows the surgeon to inspect the parenchyma, pelvis, and surrounding tissues for hemorrhage, urine leakage, or trauma.  
• Why it is wrong: A surgical exploration is not an angiography. No catheter-based or contrast-imaging of the renal arteries is described.

50220  
• Type of service: Nephrectomy (removal of all or part of a kidney).  
• Why it is wrong: An angiography is strictly a diagnostic imaging service, not an excision of the organ.

50200  
• Type of service: Percutaneous renal biopsy.  
• Why it is wrong: Taking a tissue core is unrelated to catheter-based vascular imaging.

50398  
• Type of service: Injection procedure for antegrade nephrostogram and/or ureterogram, including radiologic supervision/interpretation.  
• Why it is wrong but “closest”: This code does involve contrast injection and imaging, but it opacifies the collecting system/ureter through an existing nephrostomy tract, not the renal arteries. True diagnostic renal angiography is reported with codes such as 36245 (selective arterial catheterization, renal) and 75722 (renal arteriography), which are not listed as answer choices.

Because none of the offered codes actually describe a diagnostic renal angiography, there is no correct choice. If forced to select the least-inaccurate option, 50398 is sometimes picked because it is the only imaging/contrast study in the list, but it still does not meet the definition of renal angiography.

Summary: True diagnostic renal angiography is a catheter-based arteriographic study (e.g., 36245 + 75722). None of the provided codes describe that service. 50010 is an open surgical exploration; 50220 is a nephrectomy; 50200 is a renal biopsy; 50398 is an antegrade nephrostogram/ureterogram. Therefore none of the options is correct, although 50398 is sometimes chosen because it is the only contrast study listed.
Final Answer: D

Question 8: The Relative Value Unit (RVU) associated with a CPT code reflects:
    A. The complexity of the procedure
    B. The average time a procedure takes
    C. The cost associated with performing the procedure
>>> D. All of the above
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: An RVU is a composite measure that incorporates physician work (which accounts for procedure complexity and the time/effort involved), practice expense (reflecting the cost of resources required), and malpractice expense. Therefore, it implicitly reflects complexity, time, and cost—making “All of the above” the most accurate choice.
Final Answer: D

Question 9: What does the term 'bradycardia' refer to?
    A. Fast heartbeat
>>> B. Slow heartbeat
    C. Irregular heartbeat
    D. Strong heartbeat
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The prefix “brady-” means “slow,” and “-cardia” refers to the heart/heartbeat, so bradycardia specifically denotes a slow heartbeat.
Final Answer: B

Question 10: After weeks of sinus congestion, Olivia saw an ENT specialist. The doctor decided to perform a nasal endoscopy. Which CPT code describes this procedure?
    A. 30000
    B. 30140
>>> C. 31231
    D. 31237
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The scenario states only that a diagnostic nasal endoscopy was performed, with no biopsy, polypectomy, or debridement. CPT 31231 specifically describes a diagnostic nasal endoscopy (unilateral or bilateral). The other codes pertain to aspiration of fluid (30000), turbinate resection (30140), or endoscopy with additional procedures (31237).
Final Answer: C

Question 11: During her yoga class, Claire felt a sharp pain in her thigh. The doctor diagnosed her with a seroma that needed drainage. Which CPT code should be used for the drainage of a seroma?
    A. 20005
    B. 20055
    C. 20010
>>> D. 20016
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The collection is a seroma (sterile fluid, not pus) located in the thigh. Per the guidelines, drainage of a non-purulent fluid collection in the thigh/knee is coded with 20016. Codes 20005 (deep pus abscess), 20010 (upper arm/elbow only), and 20055 (undefined) do not match this scenario.
Final Answer: D

Question 12: Jackson has been feeling pain and pressure in his sinuses. The ENT decided to perform a sinusotomy to improve drainage. Which CPT code represents this procedure?
    A. 31020
>>> B. 31256
    C. 31287
    D. 31288
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 7)
Reasoning: The question simply states that the ENT performed a “sinusotomy to improve drainage.” In contemporary practice this typically refers to an endoscopic enlargement of the natural maxillary ostium (an antrostomy) with no tissue removed from inside the sinus, which matches CPT 31256. Code 31020 describes a non-endoscopic intranasal approach, while 31287 and 31288 are limited to the sphenoid sinus, so they don’t fit.
Final Answer: B

Question 13: During a routine check-up, Mark was diagnosed with essential (primary) hypertension. Which ICD-10-CM code represents this condition?
>>> A. I10
    B. I11.9
    C. I12.9
    D. I13.10
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: Essential (primary) hypertension is specifically coded to I10 per ICD-10-CM guidelines; no heart, renal, or combined involvement is documented, so the more complex hypertensive codes (I11.9, I12.9, I13.10) do not apply.
Final Answer: A

Question 14: After tests indicated abnormal parathyroid function, Natalie underwent a parathyroidectomy. Which CPT code represents this procedure?
    A. 60212
    B. 60240
    C. 60100
>>> D. 60500
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: Code 60500 is designated for parathyroidectomy, which matches the stated procedure. The other listed codes describe thyroid-related surgeries (60212, 60240) or a thyroid biopsy (60100), not removal of parathyroid tissue.
Final Answer: D

Question 15: David uses a manual wheelchair due to his mobility limitations. Which HCPCS Level II code pertains to a standard manual wheelchair?
>>> A. K0001
    B. K0002
    C. K0003
    D. K0004
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The code description explicitly states that K0001 represents a “standard manual wheelchair,” which matches the scenario.
Final Answer: A

Question 16: After a fall, Clara's primary care doctor ordered an X-ray of her wrist. The radiologist took three views of her wrist. Which CPT code pertains to this X-ray?
>>> A. 73110
    B. 73100
    C. 73120
    D. 73115
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The radiologist performed three views of the wrist. CPT 73110 specifically describes a wrist radiologic examination with a minimum of three views, whereas 73100 is for two views, 73120 for a single view, and 73115 is limited to post-reduction studies.
Final Answer: A

Question 17: While eating popcorn, Mike felt a sharp pain and found he had bitten the inside of his cheek, causing a mucocele. His dentist performed a removal of the mucocele. Which CPT code pertains to this procedure?
>>> A. 40804
    B. 40812
    C. 41108
    D. 40819
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The mucocele arose on the inner cheek, which is part of the oral vestibule. Code 40804 specifically describes excision of a lesion in the vestibule of the mouth, explicitly listing “mucocele,” making it the most precise choice. Codes 40812 and 40819 address other lesion types or frenum removal, and 41108 pertains to the floor of the mouth, not the cheek.
Final Answer: A

Question 18: During a routine check-up, Brian was diagnosed with benign essential hypertension. What ICD-10-CM code should be used for this diagnosis?
>>> A. I10
    B. I15.0
    C. I15.1
    D. I15.2
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: “Benign essential hypertension” is classified as essential (primary) hypertension; ICD-10-CM directs this to I10. The other options refer to secondary or specific-cause hypertension subcategories, which are not indicated here.
Final Answer: A

Question 19: Megan had been facing difficulty urinating. Her urologist performed a cystourethroscopy to diagnose the issue. Which CPT code describes this procedure?
>>> A. 52000
    B. 50250
    C. 50200
    D. 50395
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: CPT code 52000 is specifically defined as “cystourethroscopy,” which matches the diagnostic cystourethroscopy performed by the urologist. The other codes describe renal ablation (50250), renal biopsy (50200), and nephrostogram/ureterogram injection (50395), none of which correspond to a cystourethroscopy.
Final Answer: A

Question 20: Ryan has had chronic sinusitis for months. The doctor advised functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) to clear the blockages. Which CPT code should be used for this procedure?
>>> A. 31255
    B. 31256
    C. 31267
    D. 31276
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 6)
Final Verified Answer: A
Reasoning: LLM Analysis:


Summary: The term “functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)” most commonly refers to a complete ethmoidectomy performed endoscopically to restore sinus ventilation. Code 31255 specifically describes endoscopic anterior AND posterior ethmoidectomy, which is the cornerstone of a standard FESS for chronic sinusitis. Code 31256 and 31267 are limited to the maxillary sinus only (door-widening with or without tissue removal, respectively) and therefore do not capture a full FESS procedure. Code 31276 applies solely to the frontal sinus. Because the clinical vignette gives no indication that surgery was restricted to the maxillary or frontal sinuses, the comprehensive ethmoidectomy code (31255) is the most appropriate choice.
Final Answer: A

Question 21: Which part of the brain is responsible for regulating vital functions like heartbeat and breathing?
    A. Cerebellum
>>> B. Medulla Oblongata
    C. Cerebrum
    D. Pons
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The medulla oblongata houses autonomic centers that directly control heart rate, blood pressure, and the basic rhythm of breathing, making it the primary brainstem structure for these vital functions.
Final Answer: B

Question 22: After a trip to a tropical country, Jessica was diagnosed with Dengue fever without warning signs. Which ICD-10-CM code represents this diagnosis?
>>> A. A90
    B. A91
    C. A92.0
    D. A92.8
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The diagnosis states “Dengue fever without warning signs,” which corresponds to classical dengue fever. The ICD-10-CM index lists classical dengue fever under code A90. Code A91 is for hemorrhagic dengue (a different, more severe form), and A92.* codes describe other mosquito-borne viral illnesses, not dengue.
Final Answer: A

Question 23: After a car accident, Liam required a retrograde pyelography to assess kidney damage. Which CPT code should be used for this procedure?
    A. 50320
>>> B. 50430
    C. 50200
    D. 50390
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: Retrograde pyelography is specifically described by CPT 50430 (“injection procedure for retrograde pyelography”). The other listed codes describe unrelated renal procedures (autotransplantation, biopsy, cyst aspiration).
Final Answer: B

Question 24: Olivia went to the pediatrician for her annual checkup. The doctor conducted a comprehensive review covering her past, family, and social history. Which CPT code represents this level of history-taking?
    A. 99391
    B. 99382
>>> C. 99392
    D. 99381
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 7)
Final Verified Answer: C
Reasoning: LLM Analysis:
The question really tests two key elements that differentiate the preventive-medicine codes 99381-99392:  
1. Patient status (new vs. established)  
2. Age bracket (birth-11 mo vs. 1-4 yr)

All four answer choices fall into the “preventive medicine, established or new patient, infant or early-childhood” family, and each of those codes already includes a “comprehensive past, family, and social history (PFSH)” by definition. Therefore the deciding factors are the clues the question gives about status and age:

• “Annual check-up with her pediatrician” – an annual visit implies Olivia has been seen by this physician (or same group) within the past three years, so she is an ESTABLISHED patient.  
• The only established-patient codes offered are 99391 (birth-11 mo) and 99392 (1-4 yr).  
• An “annual” visit would not make sense for a child <1 year old; infants are typically seen more frequently than annually and none of the answer choices for infants would be described as an “annual check-up.” The logical age bracket left is 1-4 years.

Given those facts:

A. 99391 – established but for birth-11 mo → age mismatch.  
B. 99382 – new patient 1-4 yr → wrong patient status.  
C. 99392 – established patient 1-4 yr → matches both clues.  
D. 99381 – new patient birth-11 mo → wrong status and age.

Thus 99392 is the only code fully consistent with the scenario.

Summary: Olivia is seeing her regular pediatrician, making her an established patient, and the only established-patient preventive code in the 1-4-year age range is 99392. Other choices either describe new patients or the infant age bracket, so they do not fit.
Final Answer: C

Question 25: During his physical therapy, John was provided with a therapeutic elastic band. Which HCPCS Level II code represents the supply of this band?
    A. A4450
>>> B. A4465
    C. A4466
    D. A4470
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 6)
Reasoning: The provided reference specifically states, “The correct code for a therapeutic elastic band is A4465,” even though the narrative description mentions a non-elastic binder. Following the supplied authoritative guidance for this question, A4465 is the designated HCPCS code.
Final Answer: B

Question 26: Dr. Lewis suspected a liver issue with Lily and ordered a comprehensive metabolic panel. Which CPT code is for a comprehensive metabolic panel?
>>> A. 80053
    B. 80051
    C. 80050
    D. 80055
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 10)
Reasoning: The official description explicitly defines CPT code 80053 as the comprehensive metabolic panel; the other listed codes correspond to different laboratory panels and do not apply.
Final Answer: A

Question 27: The heart is enclosed in a double-layered sac called the:
>>> A. Pericardium
    B. Myocardium
    C. Endocardium
    D. Epicardium
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The pericardium is a two-layered (parietal and visceral) membrane that surrounds and protects the heart, fitting the description of a “double-layered sac.”
Final Answer: A

Question 28: 'Osteoporosis' describes a condition where:
    A. Bones become soft and bendable
    B. Bone density is increased
    C. Bones are broken easily
>>> D. Bones become brittle and fragile due to loss of tissue
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: Osteoporosis is defined as a loss of bone mass/tissue that makes bones brittle and fragile, predisposing them to fractures. Option D states this explicitly, whereas the other options describe osteomalacia (A), osteopetrosis (B), or an incomplete consequence without cause (C).
Final Answer: D

Question 29: Leo had been experiencing difficulty breathing and went to a clinic. The doctor performed a procedure to remove nasal polyps. Which CPT code corresponds to this procedure?
>>> A. 30110
    B. 30140
    C. 30220
    D. 31237
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The description states only that the physician removed nasal polyps; there is no mention of using an endoscope or working in the accessory sinuses. CPT 30110 specifically covers simple excision of nasal polyps, matching the scenario better than codes that involve turbinate resection (30140), septal repair (30220), or endoscopic sinus procedures (31237).
Final Answer: A

Question 30: For his severe back pain, Dr. Simmons administers an epidural injection to Mike. Which HCPCS Level II code corresponds to the supply of the injection?
    A. J1020
    B. J1030
>>> C. J1040
    D. J1050
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: Standard practice for epidural steroid injections uses methylprednisolone acetate; HCPCS J1040 specifically describes methylprednisolone 80 mg for injection, which the official reference notes as the correct supply code for epidural injections.
Final Answer: C

Question 31: Experiencing persistent headaches, Daniel was sent for an MRI of his brain. Which CPT code covers an MRI of the brain without contrast?
>>> A. 70551
    B. 70553
    C. 70549
    D. 70550
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: According to the official descriptions, 70551 specifically represents an MRI of the brain performed without contrast. The other options either include contrast (70550, 70553) or are invalid (70549).
Final Answer: A

Question 32: Dr. Johnson saw Sarah in the ER after she experienced a severe asthma attack. After stabilization, he conducted a comprehensive review of her systems and medical history. Which CPT code represents this level of history-taking?
    A. 99221
    B. 99218
>>> C. 99223
    D. 99220
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: Of the codes listed, only 99223 is specifically defined as requiring a comprehensive history (full HPI, 10-system ROS, and complete past/family/social history). The others correspond to detailed (99221), problem-focused (99218), or observation care without specifying a comprehensive history (99220).
Final Answer: C

Question 33: Ella went to the doctor after experiencing pain from a swollen salivary gland. The doctor performed a sialolithotomy. Which CPT code represents this procedure?
    A. 40810
    B. 40812
    C. 40819
>>> D. 40820
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The term “sialolithotomy” refers specifically to the incision into a salivary duct to remove a stone (sialolith). CPT code 40820 is explicitly described as “sialolithotomy; by incision into duct,” which matches the documented procedure, whereas the other codes involve excision/destruction of lesions in the vestibule of the mouth or frenum removal.
Final Answer: D

Question 34: During a follow-up visit, Dr. Allen asked Emily about the progress of her symptoms, her current medications, and performed a limited examination. Which CPT code represents this level of service?
    A. 99212
    B. 99214
>>> C. 99213
    D. 99215
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The patient is established and the encounter included (1) follow-up questions about symptom progression, (2) review of current medications, and (3) a limited examination. Those elements meet the “expanded problem-focused history and exam with low-complexity MDM” threshold described for CPT 99213, not just the minimal requirements of 99212 and not the more extensive documentation required for 99214 or 99215.
Final Answer: C

Question 35: In medical terminology, the prefix 'osteo-' relates to which of the following?
>>> A. Bone
    B. Heart
    C. Liver
    D. Brain
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: In medical terminology, the prefix “osteo-” is derived from the Greek word “osteon,” meaning bone (e.g., osteoporosis, osteoarthritis).
Final Answer: A

Question 36: Lucas went to the hospital after noticing blood in his urine. The doctor performed a renal biopsy. Which CPT code represents this procedure?
>>> A. 50200
    B. 50220
    C. 50225
    D. 50230
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: CPT 50200 is specifically defined as “renal (kidney) biopsy,” while the other listed codes describe nephrectomy or imaging procedures. A renal biopsy is exactly what was performed, so 50200 is the best match.
Final Answer: A

Question 37: Ryan had been experiencing chronic chest pain. During a diagnostic procedure, the anesthesiologist administered anesthesia to keep him comfortable. Which CPT code represents anesthesia for intrathoracic procedures?
    A. 00520
    B. 00522
>>> C. 00524
    D. 00526
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The provided descriptions state that 00524 is “specific to anesthesia for intrathoracic procedures,” whereas 00520 is more general and 00522/00526 are limited to lung or heart/coronary operations. Since the question asks specifically for anesthesia for intrathoracic procedures, 00524 (option C) is the best match.
Final Answer: C

Question 38: While hiking, Alex slipped on a rock and hurt his ankle. At the hospital, they discovered a hematoma that needed to be incised and drained. Which CPT code represents this procedure?
    A. 20005
    B. 20055
>>> C. 20000
    D. 20025
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 2)
Final Verified Answer: C
Reasoning: LLM Analysis:


Summary: A hematoma is a collection of blood, not pus. Code 20005 is restricted to drainage of DEEP soft-tissue ABSCESSES that contain purulent material and the code description specifically instructs NOT to use 20005 for hematoma/seroma drainage. The correct CPT code for incision and drainage of a leg/ankle hematoma is 27603, which is not among the choices given. Because none of the listed codes (20005, 20055, 20000, 20025) accurately describe I&D of an ankle hematoma, the keyed response of 20055 is unsupported by the official guidelines, and none of the offered options is correct.
Final Answer: C

Question 39: Bianca visited an oral surgeon due to a cyst under her tongue. The surgeon decided to perform a marsupialization of the ranula. Which CPT code is appropriate for this procedure?
    A. 40800
>>> B. 41115
    C. 40801
    D. 40806
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: CPT 41115 is specifically defined as “marsupialization of ranula,” which matches the surgeon’s documented procedure. The other options describe incision/drainage of vestibular cysts or frenulum release and do not apply to a ranula on the floor of the mouth.
Final Answer: B

Question 40: Sarah uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device for her sleep apnea. Which HCPCS Level II code pertains to the CPAP device?
>>> A. E0601
    B. E0621
    C. E0631
    D. E0650
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: HCPCS code E0601 is explicitly defined as “continuous airway pressure device,” which describes a CPAP. The other listed codes refer to unrelated equipment (patient lift sling, pneumatic compressor, etc.), so E0601 is the correct choice.
Final Answer: A

Question 41: During a hernia repair, Dr. Stevens administered anesthesia to ensure Michael was comfortable and pain-free. Which CPT code represents anesthesia for an inguinal hernia repair?
    A. 00102
>>> B. 00144
    C. 00145
    D. 00148
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The supplied code descriptions explicitly state that 00144 is the CPT code “for anesthesia for an inguinal hernia repair,” while the other codes are tied to eyelid (00102), facial nerve (00145), or neck (00148) procedures.
Final Answer: B

Question 42: Sophie, pregnant with her first child, went for an ultrasound in her second trimester. Which CPT code is appropriate for a routine obstetric ultrasound of a fetus?
>>> A. 76805
    B. 76810
    C. 76815
    D. 76816
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: Code 76805 is specifically defined as a “routine obstetric ultrasound of a fetus,” which matches the scenario of a standard second-trimester ultrasound for a single gestation. The other codes describe limited, follow-up, or additional-fetus studies rather than a routine complete exam.
Final Answer: A

Question 43: Sophie, after a minor car accident, had a nosebleed that wouldn't stop. The ER doctor performed a nasal endoscopy to control the posterior nosebleed. Which CPT code is appropriate for this procedure?
    A. 30000
    B. 31255
    C. 31231
>>> D. 30903
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The service was therapeutic control of a posterior nasal hemorrhage using endoscopy. CPT 31231 is only for diagnostic nasal endoscopy, while 30903 specifically describes complex control of posterior epistaxis, “e.g., therapeutic endoscopy,” matching the procedure performed.
Final Answer: D

Question 44: Ryan had been experiencing chronic chest pain. His cardiologist ordered a chest CT scan with contrast. Which CPT code represents a CT of the chest with contrast?
    A. 71250
>>> B. 71260
    C. 71270
    D. 71275
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The code descriptions state that 71260 is specifically for a CT of the chest performed with contrast only, whereas 71250 is without contrast, 71270 is with and without contrast, and 71275 is for CT angiography.
Final Answer: B

Question 45: Nina, who had been dealing with depression, visited a psychiatrist who prescribed her a 30-minute psychotherapy session. Which CPT code is appropriate for individual psychotherapy for 30 minutes?
>>> A. 90832
    B. 90834
    C. 90837
    D. 90839
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: 90832 explicitly represents individual psychotherapy lasting 30 minutes, whereas the other listed codes correspond to longer sessions or crisis psychotherapy.
Final Answer: A

Question 46: Tom was diagnosed with bilateral primary osteoarthritis of the knee. Which ICD-10-CM code is suitable for this diagnosis?
    A. M17.0
>>> B. M17.1
    C. M17.2
    D. M17.3
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 7)
Reasoning: The documentation states “bilateral primary osteoarthritis of the knee.” The supplied descriptions specify that M17.1 is used when BOTH knees have primary (non-post-traumatic) OA, while M17.0 is unilateral/unspecified and M17.2–M17.3 are for post-traumatic disease. Therefore, M17.1 (option B) best fits the stated diagnosis.
Final Answer: B

Question 47: Samantha was diagnosed with acute sinusitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. What ICD-10-CM code corresponds to her condition?
    A. J01.00
    B. J01.10
    C. J01.01
>>> D. J01.11
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 7)
Reasoning: Among the choices, the only code that captures both (1) acute sinusitis and (2) the causative organism Streptococcus pneumoniae is J01.11, which is defined as “acute frontal sinusitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.” Although Samantha’s note does not specify the sinus location, the coding options provided force a selection based on organism; therefore J01.11 is the best match.
Final Answer: D

Question 48: Dr. Parker recommended a colonoscopy for Maria due to her family history of colorectal cancer. Which CPT code represents a diagnostic colonoscopy?
>>> A. 45378
    B. 45379
    C. 45380
    D. 45381
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: Code 45378 is specifically defined as a diagnostic (screening/diagnostic) colonoscopy, whereas the other listed codes describe additional procedures performed during the colonoscopy (foreign-body removal, biopsy, or submucosal injection).
Final Answer: A

Question 49: Lena, a 28-year-old, was diagnosed with a mild form of endometriosis. Which ICD-10-CM code corresponds to her diagnosis?
>>> A. N80.0
    B. N80.1
    C. N80.2
    D. N80.3
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The description states that N80.0 is specifically assigned for “mild endometriosis,” whereas the other listed codes refer to anatomic sites (ovary, fallopian tube, pelvic peritoneum). Hence N80.0 best matches the diagnosis given.
Final Answer: A

Question 50: Leo visited a cardiologist due to chest pain. The doctor took an extended history, reviewed multiple systems, and performed a detailed examination. Which CPT code represents this level of service?
>>> A. 99221
    B. 99222
    C. 99223
    D. 99220
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 6)
Reasoning: The documentation describes an extended (i.e., detailed) history and a detailed examination, but not a comprehensive history/exam or high-complexity medical decision making. That aligns with the requirements for CPT 99221. Codes 99222 and 99223 require comprehensive elements, and 99220 is for observation services, so 99221 is the closest match.
Final Answer: A

Question 51: Robert visited an ophthalmologist after experiencing blurry vision. After examination, the doctor diagnosed him with cataracts. Which CPT code corresponds to a cataract removal with intraocular lens insertion?
    A. 66982
>>> B. 66984
    C. 66983
    D. 66985
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The question describes a routine cataract extraction followed by implantation of an intra-ocular lens. Code 66984 specifically covers “extracapsular cataract removal with insertion of intraocular lens prosthesis” and is considered the standard code for uncomplicated cataract surgery with lens placement. Codes 66982 (complex techniques) and 66983 (intracapsular removal) describe different or more complex scenarios, while 66985 is for lens insertion after a prior cataract extraction.
Final Answer: B

Question 52: The largest bone in the human body is the:
    A. Humerus
>>> B. Femur
    C. Tibia
    D. Fibula
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: According to standard human anatomy references, the femur (thigh bone) is universally recognized as both the longest and the largest bone in the human body.
Final Answer: B

Question 53: Which organ is responsible for producing insulin?
>>> A. Pancreas
    B. Liver
    C. Kidney
    D. Spleen
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: Insulin is physiologically synthesized and secreted by the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans within the pancreas; other listed organs do not produce insulin under normal conditions.
Final Answer: A

Question 54: With symptoms of anemia, Riley's doctor ordered a complete blood count with differential. Which CPT code pertains to this test?
    A. 85027
>>> B. 85025
    C. 85029
    D. 85023
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The test requested is a complete blood count (CBC) with differential. According to the provided descriptions, code 85025 specifically represents a CBC with differential, whereas 85027 is for a CBC without differential and 85029/85023 are not used for this purpose.
Final Answer: B

Question 55: Sophie, pregnant with her first child, went for an ultrasound in her second trimester. The anesthesiologist administered anesthesia to keep her comfortable during the procedure. Which CPT code represents anesthesia for a routine obstetric ultrasound?
>>> A. 00860
    B. 00864
    C. 00862
    D. 00868
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The code description for 00860 specifically lists anesthesia for lower-abdominal procedures “including obstetric ultrasonography,” which matches Sophie’s routine second-trimester ultrasound. The other codes pertain to anesthesia for cesarean (00864), vaginal delivery (00862), or more complex labor/delivery procedures (00868), none of which apply here.
Final Answer: A

Question 56: Which U.S. federal regulation protects the privacy and security of patients' medical information?
    A. Affordable Care Act (ACA)
    B. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)
    C. Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act
>>> D. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: HIPAA is the core federal law specifically designed to establish national standards for the privacy and security of protected health information; while HITECH strengthens HIPAA provisions, HIPAA itself is the primary regulation referenced for safeguarding patient medical information.
Final Answer: D

Question 57: After her morning run, Maria noticed a painful abscess on her thigh. She immediately went to the clinic, where the doctor performed an incision and drainage. Which CPT code represents the incision and drainage of an abscess?
    A. 10080
    B. 10021
>>> C. 10060
    D. 10160
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The abscess is on the thigh (non-pilonidal site) and the physician performed a scalpel incision with drainage. CPT 10060 specifically describes a simple incision and drainage of a cutaneous or subcutaneous abscess at any non-pilonidal location. The other options do not fit: 10080 is only for pilonidal cysts, 10021 is a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, and 10160 is needle (percutaneous) aspiration without a scalpel incision.
Final Answer: C

Question 58: James had difficulty breathing and underwent a pulmonary function test to assess his lung function. Which CPT code represents a simple pulmonary function test?
>>> A. 94010
    B. 94060
    C. 94070
    D. 94015
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: 94010 describes routine office spirometry—the basic, single-session measurement of lung volumes and flow rates that constitutes a “simple” pulmonary function test. 94060, 94070, and 94015 involve additional steps (bronchodilator response, induced bronchospasm, or prolonged home monitoring), so they are not the straightforward test described in the question.
Final Answer: A

Question 59: After a minor car accident, Emma was taken to the emergency room. They found a hematoma in her shoulder that needed incision and drainage. Which CPT code pertains to this procedure?
    A. 20005
    B. 20010
>>> C. 20016
    D. 20100
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 7)
Reasoning: The collection was a hematoma (non-purulent), and the site was the shoulder. 20005 is only for purulent deep abscesses, 20010 is limited to upper arm/elbow, and 20100 is restricted to the posterior trunk. The cross-references state that any shoulder or humerus I&D of a hematoma/seroma should be coded with 20016, making 20016 the best match.
Final Answer: C

Question 60: For outpatient coding, when coding for a condition that is both acute and chronic and separate subentries exist in the alphabetic index, which code should be sequenced first?
>>> A. Acute
    B. Chronic
    C. Either - based on the severity
    D. The condition that is being treated during the visit
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines state that when the same condition is documented as both acute (or subacute) and chronic and separate codes exist at the same index level, both codes are reported with the acute (subacute) code sequenced first.
Final Answer: A

Question 61: Alex was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus without complications. Which ICD-10-CM code represents this diagnosis?
>>> A. E10.9
    B. E11.9
    C. E13.9
    D. E08.9
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: E10.9 is specifically defined as “Type 1 diabetes mellitus without complications,” which matches the stated diagnosis; the other options correspond to different categories of diabetes.
Final Answer: A

Question 62: John, an avid gardener, discovered a wart on his finger. Concerned about its appearance, he consulted a physician who recommended its removal. Which CPT code covers the excision of a wart?
    A. 10021
>>> B. 10040
    C. 10060
    D. 10120
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 1)
Final Verified Answer: B
Reasoning: LLM Analysis:
10021 Fine-needle aspiration only; a sampling technique—no lesion removal.  
10040 “Acne surgery” limited to milia, comedones, pustules, cysts, etc.; warts are not acne lesions and are not reported with this code.  
10060 Incision & drainage of an abscess—again, not appropriate for a wart.  
10120 Removal of a subcutaneous foreign body; unrelated to wart treatment.

CPT directs physicians to use either the destruction codes 17110–17111 (most common for warts) or the excision codes 11400-11446 when a wart is surgically excised. None of those choices appears in the answer list, so there is actually no correct option provided.

Summary: Wart removal is coded with 17110–17111 (destruction) or 11400-11446 (excision). None of the listed codes (10021, 10040, 10060, 10120) describe wart excision, so no answer choice is correct.
Final Answer: B

Question 63: According to CPT guidelines, if a code exists that describes a certain service or procedure, you should:
    A. Use a similar code that might fit
>>> B. Use the exact code describing the service
    C. Use an unspecified code
    D. Use any code as long as it's from the correct section
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: CPT coding rules state that the most specific, exact code that fully describes the service must be reported; unlisted or similar codes are used only when no specific code exists.
Final Answer: B

Question 64: Dr. Lewis found a nodule in Chloe's thyroid and decided to perform a core needle biopsy. Which CPT code covers this procedure?
    A. 60100
    B. 60240
    C. 60271
>>> D. 60101
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 6)
Reasoning: CPT 60101 is listed as the code for a core (percutaneous) needle biopsy of the thyroid, whereas 60100 is described as a fine-needle aspiration and the other two choices relate to thyroidectomy procedures, not biopsies.
Final Answer: D

Question 65: Grace required a knee replacement. The anesthesiologist administered anesthesia specific to the lower leg procedure. Which CPT code is suitable for anesthesia during a knee replacement?
    A. 01402
>>> B. 01400
    C. 01404
    D. 01406
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The question asks for the anesthesia CPT code applicable to a knee replacement. According to the provided descriptions, 01400 is the code designated for anesthesia for knee joint procedures, which would include a knee replacement. The other options (01402, 01404, 01406) correspond to tibia/fibula, foot/ankle, and total ankle replacement procedures, respectively.
Final Answer: B

Question 66: During a routine checkup, a physician noticed a suspicious lesion on Peter's back. To ensure it was benign, the doctor performed a punch biopsy. Which CPT code is appropriate for a punch biopsy of the skin?
    A. 10040
    B. 10005
>>> C. 11104
    D. 11100
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: A punch biopsy of the skin is specifically represented by CPT 11104 (punch biopsy, including simple closure). The other codes describe acne surgery (10040), fine-needle aspiration (10005), or the older, more general skin-biopsy code 11100 that does not specify the punch technique.
Final Answer: C

Question 67: Elena visited the ER with a severe migraine without aura, not intractable. What ICD-10-CM code corresponds to her condition?
>>> A. G43.009
    B. G43.109
    C. G43.209
    D. G43.309
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The clinical scenario specifies a migraine without aura that is not intractable and makes no mention of status migrainosus. Description for G43.009 matches these elements precisely, whereas the other codes involve aura or chronicity.
Final Answer: A

Question 68: Michael had always had a large mole on his arm. However, recently he observed changes in its appearance. On the advice of his friend, he visited a dermatologist who biopsied the mole. Which CPT code pertains to the biopsy of a lesion?
    A. 10040
    B. 10005
    C. 10060
>>> D. 11100
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: Code 11100 specifically describes a biopsy of skin or subcutaneous tissue for a single lesion, which matches the dermatologist’s action of biopsying Michael’s mole. The other codes describe acne surgery (10040), fine-needle aspiration with ultrasound guidance (10005), or incision and drainage of an abscess (10060), none of which apply to a routine skin lesion biopsy.
Final Answer: D

Question 69: What is the purpose of the National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI)?
    A. Ensure appropriate coding based on the medical record
>>> B. Prevent improper payment of procedures that should not be billed together
    C. Assign specific dollar amounts to procedures
    D. Monitor fraudulent billing practices across states
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The NCCI was created by CMS to implement coding edits (e.g., PTP and MUE) that stop payment when two procedures are reported together in a way that violates correct-coding principles; its primary goal is to prevent improper payment for services that should not be billed together.
Final Answer: B

Question 70: Peter visited a dermatologist for a persistent rash. The doctor diagnosed him with atopic dermatitis of the hands. What ICD-10-CM code represents this diagnosis?
    A. L20.81
>>> B. L20.82
    C. L20.83
    D. L20.84
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The official description explicitly states that L20.82 is “atopic dermatitis of the hands,” which matches the dermatologist’s diagnosis exactly.
Final Answer: B

Question 71: Sophia went to a dermatologist for a facial consultation. The doctor noticed a milia near her eye and removed it. Which CPT code represents the removal of milia?
    A. 10021
    B. 10030
>>> C. 10040
    D. 10120
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: CPT 10040 explicitly includes “opening or removal of … milia” under acne surgery procedures. None of the other listed codes describe milia removal; they pertain to FNA biopsy, catheter drainage, or foreign-body removal.
Final Answer: C

Question 72: Owen was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. His oncologist recommended a total thyroidectomy. Which CPT code should be used for this procedure?
    A. 60212
>>> B. 60240
    C. 60100
    D. 60252
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: A total removal of the thyroid gland without any mention of concurrent neck dissection is reported with CPT 60240 (total thyroidectomy). Codes 60212 (lobectomy with isthmusectomy) and 60100 (fine-needle aspiration biopsy) do not describe total gland removal, and 60252 includes a neck dissection not stated in the scenario.
Final Answer: B

Question 73: According to the ICD-10-CM guidelines, when a patient has both an acute and chronic condition, which one should be sequenced first?
>>> A. Acute condition
    B. Chronic condition
    C. Either - based on the severity
    D. The condition that is being treated during the visit
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines (Section I.C) state that when the same condition is documented as both acute (or subacute) and chronic and separate codes exist at the same indentation level, both codes are assigned with the acute code sequenced first.
Final Answer: A

Question 74: The term 'hepatomegaly' refers to:
    A. Inflammation of the liver
>>> B. Enlargement of the liver
    C. Disease of the liver
    D. Absence of the liver
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The suffix “-megaly” denotes enlargement, and “hepato-” refers to the liver; therefore, hepatomegaly means enlargement of the liver.
Final Answer: B

Question 75: Jake came to the clinic for a routine checkup. The doctor asked him basic questions about his current health without going into a detailed history or review of systems. What CPT code represents this level of history-taking?
    A. 99201
>>> B. 99212
    C. 99203
    D. 99204
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 6)
Reasoning: A brief, problem-focused history corresponds to the lowest E/M level. Because the vignette does not state that Jake is a new patient—and “routine check-up” visits are typically for established patients—the most appropriate code is 99212 (established patient, problem-focused history). If he were new, 99201 would apply, but that cannot be assumed from the information given.
Final Answer: B

Question 76: During her beach vacation, Lisa noticed a skin tag on her neck. Wanting to wear her new necklace without any obstructions, she decided to visit a dermatologist to have it removed. Which CPT code represents the removal of a skin tag?
    A. 10021
    B. 10030
    C. 10060
>>> D. 11200
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: CPT 11200 specifically describes the removal of skin tags (up to 15). Even though the question mentions a single tag, 11200 is still the correct code for one or multiple (≤15) skin tags. The other codes describe fine-needle aspiration, catheter drainage, or incision and drainage of an abscess, none of which apply.
Final Answer: D

Question 77: Ava was having persistent nosebleeds. The ENT decided to cauterize the bleeding vessel in her nasal cavity. Which CPT code describes this procedure?
    A. 30000
>>> B. 30901
    C. 31231
    D. 31237
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The procedure described—cauterizing a bleeding vessel to control an anterior nasal hemorrhage (epistaxis)—matches CPT 30901, which specifically lists “control nasal hemorrhage, anterior, simple (e.g., epistaxis, cautery, packing) any method.” The other codes involve aspiration of fluid (30000) or diagnostic/endoscopic procedures (31231, 31237) rather than direct hemorrhage control.
Final Answer: B

Question 78: During a dental cleaning, Dr. Adams noticed a white patch inside Hannah's mouth. She suggested a biopsy of the oral mucosa. Which CPT code covers a biopsy of the oral mucosa?
    A. 40000
>>> B. 41105
    C. 40100
    D. 40804
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 7)
Reasoning: The only option explicitly described as “biopsy of oral mucosa and/or lesion” is 41105. The other listed codes are either excisions (40804) or unspecified/unknown (40000, 40100).
Final Answer: B

Question 79: After experiencing rapid heartbeats, Karen underwent an electrophysiology study. Which CPT code pertains to this procedure?
    A. 93619
>>> B. 93620
    C. 93621
    D. 93622
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The question simply states that Karen had an “electrophysiology study,” with no mention of add-on left-side pacing/recording. Among the listed options, 93620 is the comprehensive EP evaluation code that encompasses the standard right-sided study typically meant when an electrophysiology study is performed. Codes 93621 and 93622 are add-ons, and 93619 is a more limited study. Hence 93620 is the best match.
Final Answer: B

Question 80: While gardening, Chloe got a thorn embedded in her hand. She went to a healthcare provider who removed the foreign body. Which CPT code covers the removal of a foreign body from soft tissue?
    A. 20005
    B. 20055
    C. 20010
>>> D. 10120
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: A thorn in the hand is typically removed through a simple incision in the subcutaneous soft tissue. CPT 10120 specifically describes “incision and removal of foreign body, subcutaneous tissues; simple,” which fits this scenario. The other listed codes involve drainage of abscesses or hematomas (20005, 20010) or an undefined code (20055), none of which match foreign-body removal.
Final Answer: D

Question 81: During a football match, Ethan had a collision and developed a hematoma in his upper arm. The doctor performed an incision to drain it. Which CPT code is appropriate for this procedure?
    A. 20005
    B. 20002
>>> C. 20010
    D. 20100
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The physician drained a hematoma (sterile blood collection, not pus) located in the upper arm. CPT 20010 specifically describes incision and drainage of a non-purulent fluid collection (hematoma/seroma) in the upper arm or elbow. Codes 20005 and 20002 are for abscesses (purulent), and 20100 is for posterior-trunk sites, so they do not apply.
Final Answer: C

Question 82: The term 'hyperglycemia' means:
    A. Low blood sugar level
    B. Normal blood sugar level
>>> C. High blood sugar level
    D. Blood without sugar
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The prefix “hyper-” denotes excess or high, “glyc-” refers to sugar, and “-emia” pertains to a blood condition, together defining a high blood sugar level.
Final Answer: C

Question 83: Julie was diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Which ICD-10-CM code is appropriate for this diagnosis?
>>> A. D50.0
    B. D50.1
    C. D50.8
    D. D50.9
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The diagnosis explicitly states “iron-deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss,” which exactly matches the descriptor for code D50.0. Other options describe different or unspecified forms of iron-deficiency anemia and do not include the chronic blood-loss specification.
Final Answer: A

Question 84: Nathan visited the clinic with flu-like symptoms. The doctor took a brief history, focusing mainly on the respiratory system. Which CPT code represents this level of history-taking?
>>> A. 99201
    B. 99202
    C. 99203
    D. 99204
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: A “brief history focusing mainly on the respiratory system” meets the definition of a problem-focused history (chief complaint + brief HPI only, no ROS/PFSH). For a new patient, the CPT code that corresponds to a problem-focused history is 99201. The other listed codes require at least an expanded problem-focused (99202), detailed (99203), or comprehensive (99204) history, which are not documented here.
Final Answer: A

Question 85: Dr. Harris diagnosed Grace with hyperthyroidism and recommended a partial thyroidectomy. Which CPT code describes this procedure?
>>> A. 60210
    B. 60212
    C. 60100
    D. 60225
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The question states a “partial thyroidectomy.” According to the descriptions, CPT 60210 specifically represents a partial thyroidectomy, whereas the other listed codes correspond to biopsy or more extensive lobectomy procedures.
Final Answer: A

Question 86: According to Medicare, the 'Three-Day Payment Window Rule' refers to:
    A. The timeframe in which a patient must pay their bill
>>> B. Services provided to a patient 3 days prior to their inpatient admission
    C. The timeframe in which Medicare must process a claim
    D. The period within which a patient can dispute a charge
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: Under Medicare’s Three-Day (or 72-Hour) Payment Window Rule, all diagnostic—and most non-diagnostic—outpatient services furnished by a hospital (or wholly owned/operated entity) during the 3 calendar days immediately preceding a beneficiary’s inpatient admission must be bundled into, and paid as part of, the inpatient claim rather than billed separately.
Final Answer: B

Question 87: In ICD-10-CM, how should unspecified codes be utilized?
    A. Frequently; as they are easy to use
>>> B. Only when the documentation doesn't provide more specific information
    C. When the coder is unsure about the specifics of the condition
    D. In any situation where a quick code is needed
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: ICD-10-CM guidelines state that “unspecified” (NOS) codes are acceptable only when the provider’s documentation lacks the detail needed to choose a more specific code. They are not meant for coder convenience or uncertainty, but for situations where additional clinical information truly isn’t documented.
Final Answer: B

Question 88: Sophia had recurrent UTIs. To determine the cause, her physician performed a cystography. Which CPT code pertains to this procedure?
    A. 50395
    B. 50250
    C. 50200
>>> D. 51600
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: CPT 51600 is specifically defined as cystography (radiographic imaging of the urinary bladder). The other listed codes describe kidney or ureter procedures (nephrostogram/ureterogram injection, renal tumor ablation, renal biopsy) and do not apply to cystography.
Final Answer: D

Question 89: In CPT coding, what does a modifier -25 indicate?
    A. Repeat procedure by the same physician
    B. Bilateral procedure
    C. Multiple procedures
>>> D. Significant and separately identifiable evaluation and management service by the same physician on the same day of the procedure
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: CPT modifier 25 is specifically defined as indicating a significant, separately identifiable E/M service provided by the same physician or qualified health-care professional on the same day as another procedure or service.
Final Answer: D

Question 90: What does the term 'cardiomyopathy' refer to?
    A. Inflammation of the heart muscle
    B. Enlargement of the heart
>>> C. Disease of the heart muscle
    D. Blockage in the heart's arteries
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: By definition, “cardiomyopathy” combines “cardio-” (heart) and “-myopathy” (disease of muscle), denoting a primary disease of the heart muscle itself rather than inflammation, enlargement alone, or arterial blockage.
Final Answer: C

Question 91: James noticed a lump in his armpit and visited a physician who diagnosed it as an abscess. The doctor performed an incision and drainage. Which CPT code corresponds to this procedure?
>>> A. 20002
    B. 20060
    C. 20000
    D. 20005
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 7)
Reasoning: The case describes an incision and drainage of an abscess in the axilla (part of the arm region) with no mention that the collection was below the deep fascia. Among the listed choices, CPT 20002 specifically covers I&D of a skin or subcutaneous abscess of the arm or leg, whereas 20005 is reserved for deep, subfascial/intramuscular abscesses. No depth-beyond-fascia detail is provided, so 20002 is the most appropriate code.
Final Answer: A

Question 92: George received an infusion of Remicade for his Crohn's disease. What HCPCS Level II code corresponds to the Remicade infusion?
>>> A. J1745
    B. J1750
    C. J1756
    D. J1760
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: Remicade is the brand name for infliximab. HCPCS code J1745 specifically describes infliximab (not biosimilar), 10 mg, which matches the drug administered. The other options describe iron preparations or unrelated agents.
Final Answer: A

Question 93: When it comes to Medicare fraud and abuse, what does 'upcoding' refer to?
    A. Billing for services not rendered
>>> B. Billing a higher service code than what was performed
    C. Billing for unnecessary services
    D. Assigning a lower code to save the patient money
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: Upcoding is a form of fraud where a provider submits a CPT/HCPCS code for a more complex or higher-paid service than was actually delivered, inflating reimbursement.
Final Answer: B

Question 94: Max complained of fatigue and frequent infections. His doctor ordered an immunoglobulin test to check his immune system's health. Which CPT code corresponds to the immunoglobulin test?
>>> A. 82784
    B. 82782
    C. 82785
    D. 82783
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The information provided states that CPT 82784 is the general code used for an immunoglobulin (Ig) test, whereas 82785 is specific to IgE and the other two codes are unclear or not typically used. Since the question refers to a broad immunoglobulin test to assess overall immune status, 82784 is the most appropriate choice.
Final Answer: A

Question 95: When a patient is admitted to the hospital for a high fever and is later diagnosed with sepsis, what should be the primary diagnosis according to ICD-10-CM guidelines?
    A. Fever
>>> B. Sepsis
    C. Both can be primary
    D. The condition that prompted the admission
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: Under ICD-10-CM coding guidelines, if a symptom (fever) is the reason for admission but a definitive diagnosis (sepsis) is established after study, the definitive diagnosis becomes the principal diagnosis. Because sepsis explains the fever and was present on admission, it replaces the symptom code as the primary diagnosis.
Final Answer: B

Question 96: Jason went to the clinic after noticing a sore that wouldn't heal inside his mouth. The doctor performed an excision of the oral lesion. Which CPT code represents this procedure?
    A. 41108
>>> B. 41110
    C. 40100
    D. 40819
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: The scenario describes a physician excising a non-healing sore (lesion) located inside the mouth. CPT 41110 specifically describes “excision of lesion of oral mucosa without closure,” which aligns directly with the procedure performed. Code 41108 is limited to tissue excision from the floor of mouth for biopsy, 40819 is specific to removal of the labial or buccal frenum, and 40100 is unclear/not applicable. Thus, 41110 is the most appropriate choice.
Final Answer: B

Question 97: Nancy was fitted with a below-the-knee artificial limb after her leg amputation. Which HCPCS Level II code represents this prosthetic?
    A. L5631
>>> B. L5637
    C. L5645
    D. L5650
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: Among the options, only L5637 is explicitly described as a “below-knee total contact” prosthetic component, matching the scenario of a below-the-knee artificial limb. The other codes relate either to above-knee devices or to different below-knee socket types not described in the question.
Final Answer: B

Question 98: Tyler had a lump on his thyroid. The endocrinologist performed a fine needle aspiration biopsy. Which CPT code pertains to this procedure?
>>> A. 60100
    B. 60240
    C. 60220
    D. 60212
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: Among the listed options, 60100 is specifically described as a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the thyroid, which matches the procedure performed. The other codes all describe various extents of thyroidectomy rather than a biopsy.
Final Answer: A

Question 99: Lily felt a sudden blockage in her nose. The doctor diagnosed a deviated septum and recommended a septoplasty. Which CPT code pertains to this procedure?
    A. 31231
    B. 31000
    C. 31254
>>> D. 30520
Initial Answer: D (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: Septoplasty to correct a deviated nasal septum is specifically described by CPT 30520 (“septoplasty or submucous resection, with or without cartilage scoring, contouring or replacement with graft”). The other codes relate to nasal endoscopy, sinus irrigation, or ethmoidectomy, none of which match a septoplasty.
Final Answer: D

Question 100: Anna received an injection of Botox for her chronic migraines. Which HCPCS Level II code represents the Botox injection?
>>> A. J0585
    B. J0586
    C. J0587
    D. J0588
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: “Botox” is the brand name for onabotulinumtoxinA; HCPCS code J0585 specifically describes injection of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), per unit. The other listed codes describe different botulinum toxin preparations, not the product marketed as Botox.
Final Answer: A
