Question 1: During a regular checkup, Dr. Stevens discovered a suspicious lesion on the floor of Paul's mouth and decided to perform an excision. Which CPT code covers the excision of an oral lesion?
    A. 40800
    B. 41105
>>> C. 41113
    D. 40804
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: The description for 41113 is most directly matched to the excision of a lesion on the floor of the mouth. Options A and D involve incision procedures in the vestibule for drainage or foreign body removal, and 41105 is more specific to biopsy procedures. While documentation details could affect the final code, based on the provided descriptions, 41113 is the best match.
Final Answer: C

Question 2: While shaving, Robert accidentally caused a small cut on his chin that later became infected. He visited a healthcare provider who incised and drained the infected area. Which CPT code covers the incision and drainage of an infected cut?
    A. 10080
    B. 10021
>>> C. 10060
    D. 10160
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: Code 10060 is used for a simple incision and drainage of an abscess, which aligns with the scenario of an infected cut that required I&D. The other codes either describe procedures for pilonidal cysts (10080), fine needle aspiration (10021), or needle aspiration for culture (10160), making 10060 the most appropriate choice.
Final Answer: C

Question 3: Lucas, a professional swimmer, developed a cyst in his arm due to repetitive motion. The doctor decided to excise the cyst. Which CPT code represents the excision of a cyst?
    A. 20005
>>> B. 20055
    C. 20010
    D. 20020
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 7)
Reasoning: The other options clearly describe incision and drainage procedures (20005 and 20010) or removal of a foreign body (20020), none of which match the excision of a benign cyst. Although 20055 isn’t well‐described on the AAPC website and may require more specialized knowledge, by process of elimination it appears to be the test code representing the excision procedure for a cyst in this scenario. I acknowledge some uncertainty due to limited descriptive information, but the reasoning supports option B.

    A. 20005
    B. 20055
>>> C. 20010
    D. 20016
Initial Answer: C (Confidence: 7)
Reasoning: Among the choices, 20010 is the only code whose description specifically lists “seroma” (as well as hematoma or fluid collection), even though it is noted for the upper arm or elbow. While Claire’s seroma is in the thigh, none of the options describe a seroma drainage in that exact anatomical location. Given the available code descriptions, 20010 best captures the procedure of draining a seroma, but I acknowledge there is uncertainty due to the regional discrepancy.

Question 62: John, an avid gardener, discovered a wart on his finger. Concerned about its appearance, he consulted a physician who recommended its removal. Which CPT code covers the excision of a wart?
    A. 10021
>>> B. 10040
    C. 10060
    D. 10120
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 2)
Final Verified Answer: B
Reasoning: LLM Analysis:
The clinical service described is the surgical removal (excision or destruction) of a benign skin growth (wart).  
When the official CPT book is consulted, wart removal is ordinarily reported with:

• 17110 or 17111 – Destruction of benign lesions (e.g., common warts)  
• 11420-11426 – Excision of benign lesion, hand/finger, based on lesion size

None of those codes appear in the answer list.  
Comparing each offered code with the supplied official descriptions:

A. 10021 – Fine-needle aspiration biopsy. A diagnostic sampling procedure, not a therapeutic excision.  
B. 10040 – Acne surgery limited to milia, comedones, cysts, pustules; warts are not acne lesions and are not reported with 10040 per CPT.  
C. 10060 – Incision and drainage of an abscess; a wart is not an abscess and no drainage is performed.  
D. 10120 – Incision/removal of a foreign body; a wart is not a foreign body.

Therefore, none of the four codes correctly describe wart excision. If an answer must be selected from the list despite this mismatch, the least-incorrect (though still technically wrong) choice is 10040, because it at least involves surgical removal of a superficial skin lesion, whereas the other three codes are clearly unrelated procedures.

Summary: CPT code 10040 is limited to ‘acne surgery’ but it is the only option in the list that even marginally involves excision of a superficial skin lesion. 10021 (biopsy), 10060 (I&D abscess), and 10120 (foreign-body removal) are entirely unrelated to wart removal. The correct wart-removal codes (17110-17111 or 11420-11426) are not offered, so 10040 is the closest match among the available choices.
Final Answer: B

    D. 01406
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 7)
Reasoning: Although the description for 01402 mentions total knee arthroplasty, the provided guidelines clearly state that 01400 is appropriate for anesthesia during knee joint procedures such as a knee replacement. The other codes (01404 and 01406) are designated for other areas (foot/ankle and total ankle replacement). There is some ambiguity in the descriptions, so I have moderate confidence based on the guidelines given.

Question 94: Max complained of fatigue and frequent infections. His doctor ordered an immunoglobulin test to check his immune system's health. Which CPT code corresponds to the immunoglobulin test?
>>> A. 82784
    B. 82782
    C. 82785
    D. 82783
Initial Answer: A (Confidence: 9)
Reasoning: Code 82784 is clearly described as the general immunoglobulin test for measuring immunoglobulin concentrations (A, D, G, or M). The other codes refer to specific tests (like immunoglobulin E in code 82785) or are not clearly defined in the provided database. While I'm highly confident in this answer, the nuances in coding are always possible, so I remain conservatively confident.
Final Answer: A

Question 95: When a patient is admitted to the hospital for a high fever and is later diagnosed with sepsis, what should be the primary diagnosis according to ICD-10-CM guidelines?
    A. Fever
>>> B. Sepsis
    C. Both can be primary
    D. The condition that prompted the admission
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: According to ICD‐10-CM guidelines, the primary diagnosis is the condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for the patient's admission. Although the patient was admitted for a high fever, once sepsis is diagnosed as the underlying condition causing the fever and requiring hospitalization, sepsis becomes the primary diagnosis.
Final Answer: B

Question 96: Jason went to the clinic after noticing a sore that wouldn't heal inside his mouth. The doctor performed an excision of the oral lesion. Which CPT code represents this procedure?
    A. 41108
>>> B. 41110
    C. 40100
    D. 40819
Initial Answer: B (Confidence: 8)
Reasoning: Both 41108 and 41110 address excision procedures in the oral cavity, but 41110 specifically describes excision of a lesion on the tongue (without closure), which is the most common site for a non-healing sore in the mouth suggestive of an oral lesion. While the question does not specify the exact location, the tongue is a common site for such lesions, making 41110 the more appropriate choice. There is some uncertainty due to the unspecified exact anatomic site, but 41110 best fits the typical clinical scenario.
Final Answer: B
